# Development Guide

Development of E3SM is carefully planned and tied to goals in the proposals that fund
work on E3SM.

## Code development

Most code development occurs within one component and developers should consult the
relevant component's development guide.

Creating new initial or boundary conditions typically starts with creating a new grid.
