# cime
Common Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth

CIME, pronounced “SEAM”, contains the support scripts (configure, build, run, test), data models, essential
utility libraries, a “main” and other tools that are needed to build a single-executable coupled Earth System Model.
CIME is available in a stand-alone package that can be compiled and tested without active prognostic components
but is typically included in the source of a climate model. CIME does not contain: any active components,
any intra-component coupling capability (such as atmosphere physics-dynamics coupling).

*cime* (pronounced: seem) is currently used by the
<a href="http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu">Community Earth System Model </a>
     (CESM) and the <a href="https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/energy-exascale-earth-system-model">
Energy Exascale Earth System Model</a> (E3SM).
