# cime
Common Infrastructure for Modeling the Earth

**cime** (pronounced: seem) represents the infrastructure code for the 
<a href="http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu">Community Earth System Model </a>
     (CESM) and the Accelerated Climate Model for Energy (ACME).
*cime* includes scripts for configuration, build, and testing of
models, as well as data and stub models for climate components, 
and a code for coupling different climate components together.
     
# Developers

*cime* was initially extracted from CESM as a stand-alone capability in 2015
by members of the CSEG group at NCAR, the software engineering team of
the CESM model. The CSEG group had been developing this infrastrucure within
CESM for a number of years using NSF and DOE funding. After version 4 was released,
a joint development partnership was started with the software engineering group of
ACME, a DOE-funded project, which had branched from CESM in 2014. 
Starting with development of version 5, *cime* is cooperative effort with contributions
and ownership from members of both teams. 

The following table documents the developers who have contributed to *cime*,
showing what versions of they contributed to, and with what source(s) of support.
