The following are the test functionality categories:
  1) smoke tests
  2) restart tests
  3) threading/pe-count modification tests
  4) sequencing (layout) modification tests
  5) multi-instance tests
  6) ESMF interface tests    
  7) archiving (short-term and long-term) tests
  8) performance tests
  9) spinup tests (TODO)
 10) compiler flag assumptions (e.g. auto-promotion)


NOTES: 
- unless otherwise noted everything is run in one executable directory
- suffix: denotes the component history file suffixes that are added as part of the test
- IOP test is done along with regular tests - not as a separate test 
- IOP test is only currently valid for SMS, ERS and PET

======================================================================
    Smoke Tests
======================================================================

SMS    smoke startup test (default length) 
       do a 5 day initial test (suffix: base)
       if $IOP_ON is set then suffix is base_iop
       success for non-iop is just a successful coupler 

SBN    smoke build-namelist test (just run preview_namelist and check_input_data) 

======================================================================
    Restart Tests
======================================================================

ERS    exact restart from startup (default 6 days + 5 days) 
       do an 11 day initial test - write a restart at day 6     (suffix: base)
       if $IOP_ON is set then suffix is base_iop
       do a  5  day restart test starting from restart at day 6 (suffix: rest)
       if $IOP_ON is set then suffix is rest_iop
       compare component history files ".base" and ".rest" at day 11 

ERP    pes counts hybrid (open-MP/MPI) restart bfb test from startup, default 6 days + 5 days (previousy PER)
       initial pes set up out of the box
       do an 11 day initial test - write a restart at day 6     (suffix base) 
       half the number of tasks and threads for each component
       do a  5  day restart test starting from restart at day 6 (suffix rest)
       this is just like an ERS test but the pe-counts/threading count are modified on retart

ERI    hybrid/branch/exact restart test, default (by default STOP_N is 22 days)
       (1) ref1case
           do an initial for ${STOP_N}/6 writing restarts at ${STOP_N}/6
           ref1 case is a clone of the main case (by default this will be 4 days)
           short term archiving is on
       (2) ref2case
           do a hybrid for ${STOP_N}-${STOP_N}/6 running with ref1 restarts from ${STOP_N}/6
           and writing restarts at ( ${STOP_N} - ${STOP_N}/6 )/2 +1 
	   (by default will run for 18 days and write a restart after 10 days)
           ref2 case is a clone of the main case 
           short term archiving is on
       (3) case 
           do a branch run starting from restart written in ref2 case 	   
           and run for ???  days
       (4) case do a restart run from the branch case

======================================================================
    Threading/PE-Counts/Pe-Sequencing Tests
======================================================================

       compare base and single_thread

PEM    modified pe counts mpi bfb test (seq tests)
       do an initial run with default pe layout                               (suffix: base)
       do another initial run with modified pes (NTASKS_XXX => NTASKS_XXX/2)  (suffix: modpes)
       compare base and single_thread

PMT    modified-task and modified-thread count bfb test (previousy OEM)
       do an initial run                              (suffix: base)
       do a second run with half tasks, twice threads (suffix: modpes)
       (***note that PTM_script and PEM_script are the same - but PEM_build.csh and PTM_build.csh are different***)

PEA    single pe bfb test 
       do an initial run on 1 pe with mpi     (suffix: base)
       do the same run on 1 pe with mpiserial (suffix: mpiserial)

    Sequencing (layout) Tests (smoke)
======================================================================

SEQ    different sequencing bfb test  
       do an initial run test with out-of-box PE-layout (suffix: base)

       compare base and seq

======================================================================
    Multi-Instance Tests (smoke)
======================================================================

NCK    multi-instance validation vs single instance - sequential PE for instances (default length)
       do an initial run test with NINST 1 (suffix: base)
       do an initial run test with NINST 2 (suffix: multiinst for both _0001 and _0002)
       compare base and _0001 and _0002

NCR    multi-instance validation vs single instance - concurrent PE for instances  (default length)
       do an initial run test with NINST 1 (suffix: base)
       do an initial run test with NINST 2 (suffix: multiinst for both _0001 and _0002)
        compare base and _0001 and _0002
       (***note that NCR_script and NCK_script are the same - but NCR_build.csh and NCK_build.csh are different***)

NOC    multi-instance validation for single instance ocean (default length)
       do an initial run test with NINST 2 (other than ocn), with mod to instance 1 (suffix: inst1_base, inst2_mod)
       do an initial run test with NINST 2 (other than ocn), with mod to instance 2 (suffix: inst1_base, inst2_mod)
       compare inst1_base with inst2_base 
       compare inst1_mod  with inst2_mod  


======================================================================

CME    compare mct and esmf interfaces (default is 10 days for each)
