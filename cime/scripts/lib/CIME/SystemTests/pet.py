Implementation of the CIME PET test.  This class inherits from SystemTestsCommon

This is an openmp test to determine that changing thread counts does not change answers.
(1) do an initial run where all components are threaded by default (suffix: base)
(2) do another initial run with nthrds=1 for all components (suffix: single_thread)
