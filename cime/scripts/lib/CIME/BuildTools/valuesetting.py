    value - The actual value that will be set.
    do_append - Boolean describing whether the value should be
                appended to the existing value of the variable rather
                than overwriting other settings.
    conditions - Dictionary containing the set of values that different
                 variables have to have to use this setting (e.g.
                 DEBUG="TRUE" might be a condition on a debug flag).
    set_up - List of any commands that have to be executed in the build
             system before this setting can occur.
    tear_down - List of any commands that should be executed to clean up
                after setting the variable.

        """Check to see if this setting conflicts with another one.

        The purpose of this routine is to see if two settings can coexist
        in the same Macros file, or if doing so would raise an ambiguity
        about which one should be preferred over the other. Note that this
        is a symmetric relation (this function returns the same value if
        self and other are swapped).

        The rules to determine this are as follows:

        1) If one or both settings are appending to the value, there's no
           ambiguity, because both can cooperate to set the value.

        >>> a = ValueSetting('foo', True, dict(), [], [])
        >>> b = ValueSetting('bar', False, dict(), [], [])
        >>> a.is_ambiguous_with(b)
        False
        >>> b.is_ambiguous_with(a)
        False

        2) If the two settings have conflicting conditions, then there
           is no ambiguity because they can't both apply to the same
           build.

        >>> a = ValueSetting('foo', False, {"DEBUG": "TRUE"}, [], [])
        >>> b = ValueSetting('bar', False, {"DEBUG": "FALSE"}, [], [])
        >>> a.is_ambiguous_with(b)
        False

        3) If one setting is strictly more specific than the other, then
           there's no ambiguity, because we prefer the more specific
           setting whenever both apply to a build.

        >>> a = ValueSetting('foo', False, {"DEBUG": "TRUE"}, [], [])
        >>> b = ValueSetting('bar', False, {"DEBUG": "TRUE", "MPILIB": "mpich2"}, [], [])
        >>> a.is_ambiguous_with(b)
        False
        >>> b.is_ambiguous_with(a)
        False

        4) All other cases are considered ambiguous.

        >>> a = ValueSetting('foo', False, dict(), [], [])
        >>> b = ValueSetting('bar', False, dict(), [], [])
        >>> a.is_ambiguous_with(b)
        True
