    Additional machine speific variables that can be changed

    These variables CANNOT be modified once case_setup has been

    component task/thread settings
    if the user wants to change the values below after ./case_setup, run
    ./case_setup -clean
    ./case_setup
    to reset the pes for the run

    NTASKS are the total number of MPI tasks, a negative value in this field
                 indicates nodes rather than tasks.
    NTHRDS are the number of OpenMP threads per MPI task
    ROOTPE is the global mpi task associated with the root task
    of that component, a negative value in this field indicates nodes rather than tasks.           PSTRID is the stride of MPI tasks across the global
    set of pes (for now this is set to 1)
    NINST is the number of instances of the component (will be spread
    evenly across NTASKS)

    for example, for a setting with
    NTASKS = 8
    NTHRDS = 2
    ROOTPE = 32
    NINST  = 2
    the MPI tasks would be placed starting on global pe 32
    and each pe would be threaded 2-ways for this component.
    These tasks will be divided amongst both instances (4 tasks each).

    Note: PEs that support threading never have an MPI task associated
    with them for performance reasons.  As a result, NTASKS and ROOTPE
    are relatively independent of NTHRDS and they determine
    the layout of mpi processors between components.  NTHRDS is used
    to determine how those mpi tasks should be placed across the machine.

    The following values should not be set by the user since they'll be
    overwritten by scripts.
    TOTALPES
    CCSM_PCOST
    CCSM_ESTCOST
    PES_LEVEL
    MAX_TASKS_PER_NODE
    PES_PER_NODE
    CCSM_TCOST
    CCSM_ESTCOST

    The user can copy env_mach_pes.xml from another run, but they'll need to
    do the following
    ./case_setup -clean
    ./case_setup
    ./CASE.build
