<para>
This guide instructs both novice and experienced users on building and
running &cesm;.  If you are a new user, we recommend that the introductory
sections be read before moving onto other sections or the Quick Start procedure.
This document is written so that, as much as possible, individual sections
stand on their own and the user's guide can be scanned and sections
read in a relatively ad hoc order.  In addition, the web version provides clickable
links that tie different sections together.
</para>

<para>
The chapters attempt to provide relatively detailed information about
specific aspects of CESM such as setting up a case, building the
model, running the model, porting, and testing.  There is also a large
section of <link linkend="use_case_intro">use cases and FAQs</link>.

<title>CESM Overview</title>

<para>
The Community Earth System Model (CESM) is a coupled climate model
for simulating Earth's climate system. Composed of separate
models simultaneously simulating the Earth's atmosphere, ocean, land,
land-ice, and sea-ice, plus one central coupler component, CESM
allows researchers to conduct fundamental research into the Earth's
past, present, and future climate states.
</para>

<para>
The CESM system can be configured a number of different ways from both 
a science and technical perspective.  CESM supports numerous
<ulink url="../modelnl/grid.html">resolutions</ulink>,
and 
<ulink url="../modelnl/compsets.html">component configurations</ulink>.

In addition, each model component has input options to configure
specific model physics and parameterizations.  CESM can be run on a
number of different
<ulink url="../modelnl/machines.html">hardware platforms</ulink>, 
and has a relatively flexible design with respect
to <link linkend="case_conf_setting_pes"> processor layout
</link> of components.
CESM also supports both an internally developed set of component interfaces
and the ESMF compliant component interfaces (See <xref linkend="use_case_esmfint"/>)
</para>

<para>
The CESM project is a cooperative effort among U.S. climate
researchers. Primarily supported by the National Science Foundation
(NSF) and centered at the National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado, the CESM project enjoys close collaborations
with the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. Scientific development of the CESM is guided
by the CESM working groups, which meet twice a year. The main CESM
workshop is held each year in June to showcase results from the
various working groups and coordinate future CESM developments among
the working groups. The <ulink url="http://www2.cesm.ucar.edu/">CESM website</ulink>
provides more information on the
CESM project, such as the management structure, the scientific working
groups, downloadable source code, and online archives of data from
previous CESM experiments.

<caution><para>NetCDF must be built with the same Fortran compiler as
CESM.  In the netCDF build the FC environment variable specifies which
Fortran compiler to use.  CESM is written mostly in Fortran, netCDF is
written in C.  Because there is no standard way to call a C program
from a Fortran program, the Fortran to C layer between CESM and netCDF
will vary depending on which Fortran compiler you use for CESM.  When
a function in the netCDF library is called from a Fortran application,
the netCDF Fortran API calls the netCDF C library. If you do not use
the same compiler to build netCDF and CESM you will in most cases get
errors from netCDF saying certain netCDF functions cannot be
found.</para></caution>
<para>Parallel-netCDF, also referred to as pnetcdf, is optional.  If a
user chooses to use pnetcdf, version 1.2.0 or later should be used
with CESM.  It is a library that is file-format compatible with
netCDF, and provides higher performance by using MPI-IO.  Pnetcdf is
enabled by setting the PNETCDF_PATH variable in the Macros file. 
You must also specify that you want pnetcdf at runtime via the io_typename 
argument that can be set to either "netcdf" or "pnetcdf" for each component.  </para>

<title>CESM Components</title>

<para>
CESM consists of seven geophysical models: atmosphere (atm), sea-ice
(ice), land (lnd), river-runoff (rof), ocean (ocn), land-ice
(glc), and ocean-wave (wav - stub only), plus a coupler (cpl) that coordinates the geophysics models
time evolution and passes information between them.  Each model may
have "active," "data," "dead," or "stub" component version allowing
for a variety of "plug and play" combinations.
</para>

<para>
During the course of a CESM run, the model components integrate
forward in time, periodically stopping to exchange information with
the coupler. The coupler meanwhile receives fields from the component
models, computes, maps, and merges this information, then sends the
fields back to the component models. The coupler brokers this sequence
of communication interchanges and manages the overall time progression
of the coupled system. A CESM component set is comprised of seven
components: one component from each model (atm, lnd, rof, ocn, ice,
glc, and wav) plus the coupler. Model components are written primarily in
Fortran 90/95/2003.
</para>

<para>
The active (dynamical) components are generally fully prognostic, and
they are state-of-the-art climate prediction and analysis
tools. Because the active models are relatively expensive to run, data
models that cycle input data are included for testing, spin-up, and
model parameterization development. The dead components generate
scientifically invalid data and exist only to support technical system
testing.  The dead components must all be run together and should
never be combined with any active or data versions of models.  Stub
components exist only to satisfy interface requirements when the
component is not needed for the model configuration (e.g., the active
land component forced with atmospheric data does not need ice, ocn, or
glc components, so ice, ocn, and glc stubs are used).
</para>

<title>CESM Component Sets</title>

<para>
The &cesm; components can be combined in numerous ways to carry
out various scientific or software experiments. A particular mix of
components, <emphasis>along with</emphasis> component-specific
configuration and/or namelist settings is called a component set
or "compset." &cesm; has a shorthand naming convention
for component sets that are supported out-of-the-box.  </para>

<para> The compset name usually has a well defined first letter followed
by some characters that are indicative of the configuration setup.  Each
compset name has a corresponding short name.
Users are not limited to the predefined component set
combinations. A user may <link linkend="faq_createowncompset">define
their own component set</link>.
</para>

<para> See <ulink url="../modelnl/compsets.html">supported component
sets</ulink> for a complete list of supported compset options.
Running <link linkend= "how_to_create_case">&create_newcase;</link>
with the option "-list" will also always provide a listing of the
supported out-of-the-box component sets for the local version of
CESM.  </para>


<para>In general, the first letter of a compset name indicates which
components are used.  An exception to this rule is the use of "G" as a
second letter to indicate use of the active glc model, CISM. 
</para>

</sect2>

<!-- ======================================================================= -->
<sect2 id="ccsm_grids">
<title>CESM Grids</title>

<para>
The grids are specified in CESM by setting an overall model
resolution.  Once the overall model resolution is set, components will
read in appropriate grids files and the coupler will read in
appropriate mapping weights files.  Coupler mapping weights are always
generated externally in CESM.  The components will send the grid data
to the coupler at initialization, and the coupler will check that the
component grids are consistent with each other and with the mapping
weights files.
</para>

<para>
In CESM1.2, the ocean and ice must be on the same grid, but the
atmosphere and land and river runoff can each be on different
grids. Each component determines its own unique grid decomposition
based upon the total number of pes assigned to that component.
</para>

<para>
CESM supports several types of grids out-of-the-box including single
point, finite volume, spectral, cubed sphere, displaced pole, and
tripole. This page, <ulink url="http://www.image.ucar.edu/staff/rnair/remap.html">
Conservative Remapping on Spherical Grids</ulink>, illustrates a number of these
grid types.  These grids are used internally by the models.  Input
datasets are usually on the same grid but in some cases, they can be
interpolated from regular lon/lat grids in the data models.  The
finite volume and spectral grids are generally associated with
atmosphere and land models but the data ocean and data ice models are
also supported on those grids.  The cubed sphere grid is used only by
the active atmosphere model, cam.  And the displaced pole and tripole
grids are used by the ocean and ice models.  Not every grid can be run
by every component.  The ocean and ice models run on either a
Greenland dipole or a tripole grid. The <ulink
url="gx3v7_120309_pole.png">Greenland
Pole grid</ulink> is a latitude/longitude grid, with the North Pole
displaced over Greenland to avoid singularity problems in the ocn and
ice models. The low-resolution Greenland pole mesh from CCSM3 is illustrated
in <ulink url="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/JCLI3744.1">
Yeager et al., "The Low-Resolution CCSM3", AMS (2006), Figure 1b., Web.</ulink> 
Similarly, the <ulink

</ulink> is a latitude/longitude grid with three poles that are all
centered over land.

<title>CESM Machines</title>

<para> Scripts for supported machines and userdefined machines are
provided with the CESM release.  Supported machines have machine
specific files and settings added to the CESM scripts and are
machines that should run CESM cases out-of-the-box.  Machines are
supported in CESM on an individual basis and are usually listed by
their common site-specific name.  To get a machine ported and
functionally supported in CESM, local batch, run, environment, and
compiler information must be configured in the CESM scripts.  The
machine name "userdefined" machines refer to any machine that the user
defines and requires that a user edit the resulting xml files to fill
in information required for the target platform.
This functionality is handy in accelerating the porting process and 
quickly getting a case running on a new platform.
For more information on porting, see <xref linkend="port"/>.

Although CESM can be run out-of-the-box for a variety of
resolutions, component combinations, and machines, MOST combinations
of component sets, resolutions, and machines have not undergone
rigorous scientific climate validation.  Control runs accompany
"scientifically supported" component sets and resolution and are
documented on the release page.  These control runs should be
scientifically reproducible on the original platform or other
platforms.  Bit-for-bit reproducibility cannot be guaranteed due to
variations in compiler or system versions.  Users should carry out

After accepting the certificate, the following
authentication message will likely be generated:
</para>

<screen>
svn list https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm1/release_tags
Authentication realm: &lt;https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu:443&gt; ccsm:models

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATTENTION!  Your password for authentication realm:

   &lt;https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu:443&gt; ccsm:models

can only be stored to disk unencrypted!  You are advised to configure
your system so that Subversion can store passwords encrypted, if
possible.  See the documentation for details.

You can avoid future appearances of this warning by setting the value
of the 'store-plaintext-passwords' option to either 'yes' or 'no' in
'/glade/u/home/[username]/.subversion/servers'.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Store password unencrypted (yes/no)? yes

</screen>

<para>
Be aware that the request is set to the current machine login id and 
you must enter the CESM registered default username of 'guestuser' by
pressing the 'Enter' key when prompted for a Username.
</para>

<para> 
You may be prompted up to 3 times for the username and password 
when checking out the code for the first time from this new Subversion path. 
This is because the code is distributed across a number of different 
Subversion repositories and each repository requires authentication.
</para>

<para> 
Once correctly
entered, the username and password will be cached in a protected
subdirectory of the user's home directory so that repeated entry of
this information will not be required for a given machine.
</para>

<para>
The release tags should follow a recognizable naming pattern, and
they can be checked out from the central source repository into a local sandbox directory. 
The following example shows how to checkout model version
CESM1.2.1:
</para>

<screen>
> svn co https://svn-ccsm-models.cgd.ucar.edu/cesm1/release_tags/cesm1_2_1 cesm1_2_1
</screen>

<caution><para>If a problem was encountered during checkout, which may happen 
with an older version of the client software, it may appear to have downloaded
successfully, but in fact only a partial checkout has occurred.  
To ensure a successful download, make sure the last line of svn output 
has the following statement:
</para>
<screen>
Checked out revision XXXXX.
</screen>

<para>
<emphasis>** IMPORTANT NOTE ** Starting with CESM1.2.1, the Subversion repository path has changed. 
Consequently, the information below regarding 'svn update' or 'svn switch' is only valid for
CESM releases prior to CESM1.2.1.
</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
Or, in the case of an 'svn update' or 'svn switch':
</para>
<screen>
Updated to revision XXXXX.
</screen></caution>


<para>
This will create a directory called
<filename>cesm1_2_1</filename> that can be used to modify,
build, and run the model.  The following Subversion subcommands can
be executed in the working sandbox directory.

<title>Obtaining new release versions of CESM - prior to CESM1.2.1</title>

<para>
<emphasis>** IMPORTANT NOTE ** Starting with CESM1.2.1, the Subversion repository path has changed. 
Consequently, the information below regarding 'svn update' or 'svn switch' is only valid for
CESM releases prior to CESM1.2.1. Follow the steps outlined above to upgrade to CESM1.2.1
from previous versions of the model.
</emphasis>
</para>

<para>
To update to a newer version of the release code you can download a new version of CESM from the svn central source repository in the following way:  
</para>
<para>
Suppose for example that a new version of CESM is available at https://svn-ccsm-release.cgd.ucar.edu/model_versions/cesm1_&lt;X_newversion&gt;.
This version can be checked out directly using the same standard <link linkend="download_ccsm">CESM download method</link>.
</para>
<para>
As an alternative, some users may find the svn switch operation
useful. In particular, if you've used svn to check out the previous
release, cesm1_&lt;X_previousversion&gt;, and if you've made
modifications to that code, you should consider using the svn switch
operation.  This operation will not only upgrade your code to the
version cesm1_&lt;X_newversion&gt;, but will also attempt to reapply
your modifications to the newer version.
</para>
<procedure>
<para>
How to use the svn switch operation:
</para>
<para>
Suppose you've used svn to check out cesm1_&lt;X_previousversion&gt; into the directory
called /home/user/cesm1_1_1
</para>
<step>
<para>
Make a backup copy of /home/user/cesm1_1_1 -- this is important in case
   you encounter any problems with the update
</para>
</step>
<step>
<para>
cd to the top level of your cesm1_1 code tree...
</para>
<screen>
   > cd /home/user/cesm1_1_1
</screen>
</step>
<step>
<para>
Issue the following svn command...
</para>
<screen>
   > svn switch https://svn-ccsm-release.cgd.ucar.edu/model_versions/cesm1_&lt;X_newversion&gt;  
</screen>
</step>
</procedure>
<para>
The svn switch operation will upgrade all the code to the new cesm1_&lt;X_newversion&gt; version, and for any files that have been modified, will attempt to reapply those modifications to the newer code.
</para>

<para>
Note that an update to a newer version of the release code may result in conflicts with modified 
files in the local working copy.  These conflicts will likely require that differences
be resolved manually before use of the working copy may continue.  For help in 
resolving svn conflicts, please visit the subversion website,

<title> Downloading input data </title>

<para> Input datasets are needed to run the model. CESM input data will 
be made available through a separate Subversion input data repository.
The username and password for the input data repository will be the same
as for the code repository.  
</para>

<note><para>
The input data repository contains
datasets for many configurations and resolutions and is well over 1 TByte in 
total size.  
DO NOT try to download the entire dataset.  
</para></note>

<para>Datasets can be downloaded on a 
case by case basis as needed and CESM now provides tools to check and
download input data automatically.</para>

<para> A local input data directory should exist on the local disk, 
and it also needs to be set in the CESM scripts via the variable
$&DIN_LOC_ROOT;. For supported machines, this
variable is preset. For generic machines, this variable
is set as an argument to &create_newcase;. Multiple
users can share the same $&DIN_LOC_ROOT; directory.</para>

<para>The files in the subdirectories of
$&DIN_LOC_ROOT; should be write-protected. This prevents these
files from being accidentally modified or deleted.  The directories
in $&DIN_LOC_ROOT; should generally be group writable, 
so the directory can be shared among multiple users.</para>

<para>As part of the process of generating the &cesm; executable, the
utility, <link linkend="input_data_server"><command>check_input_data</command></link>
is called, and it attempts to locate all required input data for the case 
based upon file lists generated by components.  If the required data is not found 
on local disk in $&DIN_LOC_ROOT;, then the data will be downloaded
automatically by the scripts or it can be downloaded by the user by invoking
&check_input_data; with the -export command argument.  If you want to download
the input data manually you should do it before you build CESM.</para> 

<para>It is possible for users to download the data using
svn subcommands directly, but use of the &check_input_data; script is highly 
recommended to ensure that only the required datasets are downloaded. 
Again, users are STRONGLY DISCOURAGED from downloading the entire input dataset
from the repository due to the size.</para>
