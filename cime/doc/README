This requires Sphinx v1.7 or greater. 

Check the sphinx version as follows:

>sphinx-build --version

The documentation source is stored with the CIME master code base. However, 
the built html files are stored seperately in the orphan gh-pages branch
and can be viewed from a browser at URL:

http://esmci.github.io/cime

Details for working with the documentation are contained in the following
wiki page:

https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/wiki/Working-with-Sphinx-and-reStructuredText

Use the following commands to auto-build the html documentation from the main
cime/doc directory:

>make clean
>make api
>make html

To copy the html to the orphan gh-pages, follow these steps:

>git clone -b gh-pages https://github.com/ESMCI/cime.git cime.gh-pages
>cd cime.gh-pages
>rm -rf *
>cp -R /path/to/cime-master/doc/build/html/* .
>git commit -m 'update HTML for PR #...'
>git push origin gh-pages
