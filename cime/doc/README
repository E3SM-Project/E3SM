This requires Sphinx v1.7 or greater.

The documentation source is stored with the CIME master code base. However, 
the built html files are stored seperately in the orphan gh-pages branch
and can be viewed from a browser at URL:

http://esmci.github.io/cime

Details for working with the documentation are contained in the following
wiki page:

https://github.com/ESMCI/cime/wiki/Working-with-Sphinx-and-reStructuredText

Use the following commands to auto-build the html documentation from the main
cime/doc directory:

>make api
>make html
