\mainpage CESM Scripts API Documentation

\author CESM Software Engineering Group

This is the CESM scripts API documentation for development tags.
It is the responsibility of the programmer to
include accurate code documentation in-line with their code. Here are the general
work-flow steps for including Doxygen compartible markup in CESM API script code.
<ol>
<li>become familiar with the Doxygen markup language and syntax for your script flavor</li>
<li> document your code accurately and concisely</li>
<li> follow the normal CESM workflow for testing and repo check-in</li>
</ol>
As new development tags become available, this website will be updated accordingly to
reflect the code.

Please refer to the links below for detailed information
regarding documentation standards for CESM scripts codes to accomodate inclusion in this Doxygen web.
