/*! \page perl Perl markup conventions

Perl code documentation uses the Doxygen::Filter::Perl module input filter which is
specified in the Doxyfile configuration file. The documentation for the 
doxygen perl filter with supported markup is here:

 - http://search.cpan.org/dist/Doxygen-Filter-Perl/lib/Doxygen/Filter/Perl.pm

(Note: when adding markup tags to the perl source, spaces are significant.)
