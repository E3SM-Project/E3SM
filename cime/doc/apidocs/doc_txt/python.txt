/*! \page python Python markup conventions

Python code documentation uses the doxypypy.py Doxygen input filter which is 
specified in the Doxyfile configuration file. There are a number of sites
available that demonstrate good documentation markup for Python code using the doxypypy.py
input filter. They include:

 - https://github.com/Feneric/doxypypy
 - the CESM unit_testing python files

Here is a sample python template file that can be used as a starting point for
python programs.

\include template.py
