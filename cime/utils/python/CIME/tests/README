The directory structure of this tests directory mirrors the directory structure
of the parent (production code) directory.

So, for example, unit tests for CIME/foo.py should live in
CIME/tests/test_foo.py, and unit tests for CIME/SystemTests/bar.py should live
in CIME/tests/SystemTests/test_bar.py.
