valid values: null,copyall
The wave data is associated with the wave model
and is normally on a different grid than the ocean data.

datamode = "null"
  null is always a valid option and means no data will be generated.
  Turns off the data model as a provider of data to the coupler.
datamode = "copyall"
  Copies all fields directly from the input data streams Any required
  fields not found on an input stream will be set to zero.

Set by the following xml variables in env_run.xml
DWAV_MODE
   specifies values for wav mode: copyall,null
   default value: copyall

array of time axis modes associated with the array of streams for

to fall only between the least and greatest valid value of the time array.

<entry id="dtlimit"
type="real(30)"
category="streams"
group="shr_strdata_nml" >
array (up to 30 elements) of delta time ratio limits placed on the
time interpolation associated with the array of streams.  this real
value causes the model to stop if the ratio of the running maximum
delta time divided by the minimum delta time is greater than the
dtlimit for that stream.  for instance, with daily data, the delta
time should be exactly one day throughout the dataset and the computed
maximum divided by minimum delta time should always be 1.0.  for
monthly data, the delta time should be between 28 and 31 days and the
maximum ratio should be about 1.1.  the running value of the delta
time is computed as data is read and any wraparound or cycling is also
included.  this input helps trap missing data or errors in cycling.
to turn off trapping, set the value to 1.0e30 or something similar.

<entry id="streams"

character array (up to 30 elements) of stream input files.  this
string is actually parsed by a stream method and so the format is
specified by the stream module.  this string consists of a
"stream_input_filename year_align year_first year_last".  the
stream_input_filename is a stream text input file and the format and
options are described elsewhere.  year_align, year_first, and
year_last provide information about the time axis of the file and how
to relate the input time axis to the model time axis.
