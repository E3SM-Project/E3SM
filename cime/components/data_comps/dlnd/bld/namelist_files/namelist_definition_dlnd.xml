datamode = "NULL"
  NULL is always a valid option and means no data will be generated.  
  Turns off the data model as a provider of data to the coupler.  The
  ice_present flag will be set to false and the coupler will assume no
  exchange of data to or from the data model.
dataMode = "COPYALL"
  Copies all fields directly from the input data streams Any required
  fields not found on an input stream will be set to zero.

category="streams"
group="shr_strdata_nml" >
array (up to 30 elements) of delta time ratio limits placed on the
time interpolation associated with the array of streams.  this real
value causes the model to stop if the ratio of the running maximum
delta time divided by the minimum delta time is greater than the
dtlimit for that stream.  for instance, with daily data, the delta
time should be exactly one day throughout the dataset and the computed
maximum divided by minimum delta time should always be 1.0.  for
monthly data, the delta time should be between 28 and 31 days and the
maximum ratio should be about 1.1.  the running value of the delta
time is computed as data is read and any wraparound or cycling is also
included.  this input helps trap missing data or errors in cycling.
to turn off trapping, set the value to 1.0e30 or something similar.

character array (up to 30 elements) of stream input files.  this
string is actually parsed by a stream method and so the format is
specified by the stream module.  this string consists of a
"stream_input_filename year_align year_first year_last".  the
stream_input_filename is a stream text input file and the format and
options are described elsewhere.  year_align, year_first, and
year_last provide information about the time axis of the file and how
to relate the input time axis to the model time axis.
