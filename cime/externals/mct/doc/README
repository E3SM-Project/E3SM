To build the .dvi files for the documentation. type "make".

This will build the API's document.

To build the APIs, type "make apis"

NOTE:  this build system isn't working perfectly yet.  It will
build a .dvi file but you will need to run "bibtex" manually to
build the bibliography.

To build "by hand" using the design doc as an example:
cd to texsrc, type "make"
cd back to doc directory then do:

latex mct_APIs
bibtex mct_APIs
latex mct_APIs
latex mct_APIs
