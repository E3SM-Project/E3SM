This program demonstrates the use of MCT in a simple
coupled system consisting of two models and a coupler.

The grids used are taken from a real climate model.
"srcmodel" uses an atmosphere grid and "coupler" interpolates
data on it to an ocean grid in "dstmodel"

The srcmodel reads in a temperature field TS1.dat on the the atmosphere grid.
dstmodel outputs the interpolated temperature field to TS1out.dat

srcmodel,dstmodel and coupler  are broken into init, run and finalize phases.

The model and coupler run sequentially on a pool of processors

master.F90  - the top level program
srcmodel.F90   - the first component, an atmosphere model.
dstmodel.F90   - the second component, an ocean model.
coupler.F90 - the third component, a coupler which takes
                 the atmosphere data and maps it to
                 the ocean grid.

-----------------------------------------------------
To compile:
First make sure you have compiled MCT. See instructions in
MCT/README

Type "make" here or "make examples" in the top-level directory.

The executable is called "climate"

-----------------------------------------------------
To run:
"climate" requires a data file of interpolation weights in
the directory MCT/data.  If this directory was not present when
you untarred MCT, you can get it from the MCT website.

climate requires at least 1 MPI processes to run but can run on
any even number of processors.  Consult your
local documentation for how to run parallel programs.

Typical command:  mpirun -np 8 climate
