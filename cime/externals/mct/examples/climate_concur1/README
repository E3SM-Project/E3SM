This program demonstrates the use of MCT in a simple
coupled system consisting of a "model" and a "coupler".

The grids used are taken from a real climate model.
"model" uses an atmosphere grid and "coupler" interpolates
data on it to an ocean grid.

The model and coupler run on separate pools of processors.

master.F90  - the top level program
model.F90   - the first component, an atmosphere model.
               sends data to the coupler.
coupler.F90 - the second component, a coupler which takes
                 the received atmosphere data and maps it to
                 the ocean grid.

-----------------------------------------------------
To compile:
First make sure you have compiled MCT. See instructions in
MCT/README

Type "make" here or "make examples" in the top-level directory.

The executable is called "climate"

-----------------------------------------------------
To run:
"climate" requires a data file of interpolation weights in
the directory MCT/data.  If this directory was not present when
you untarred MCT, you can get it from the MCT website.

climate requires at least 2 MPI processes to run but can run on
any even number of processors.  Consult your
local documentation for how to run parallel programs.
Typical command:  mpirun -np 8 climate

This program will not work with mpi-serial.
