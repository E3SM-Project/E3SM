The programs in this directory demonstrate how to use basic
functions of MCT in several possible coupled configurations of
two components.

Each example is contained in one .F90 file.

To compile:
First make sure you have compiled MCT. See instructions in
MCT/README

Type "make" here or "make examples" in the top-level directory.

To run:  Consult your local documentation for how to run a parallel
program.  The examples below assume mpirun is available and you
can run interactively.   "script.babyblue" is an example of run script
for IBM systems which use a queue manager.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
twocomponent.concurrent.F90 - two components running concurrently on
  separate pools of processors.

  requires: at least 3 MPI processes
  to run:  mpirun -np 3 twocon
  note: will not work with mpi-serial

------------------------------------------
twocomponent.sequential.F90 - two components running sequentially on
  the same processors.  Uses arguments to pass data between models.
  Shows use of Rearranger.

  requires: at least 1 MPI process
  to run:  mpirun -np 1 twoseq

------------------------------------------
twocomponent.seqNB.F90      - two components running sequentially on
  the same processors.  Uses non-blocking MCT calls to pass data between
  models

  requires: at least 1 MPI process
  to run:  mpirun -np 1 twoseqNB

------------------------------------------
twocomponentUneven.sequential.F90 - two components running sequentially but
  one model is only running on some of the shared processors.

  requires: no more than 12 processors
  to run:  mpirun -np 2 twosequn

------------------------------------------
