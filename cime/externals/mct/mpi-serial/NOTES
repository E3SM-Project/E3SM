*** NOTES

*** need to look at Request struct, add a type
    so that send.c and recv.c can use distinct send and recv types

*** need to add types in mpi.h and mpif.master.h to type.{c,h}


*** need to look at config and how it sets _RSIZE_ and _DSIZE_

    previously: MCT's configure set env FORT_SIZE
                choose mpif.h from mpif.$FORT_SIZE.h

    now: FORT_SIZE ignored
         configures sets FSIZE_REAL and FSIZE_DPRECISION based on mpi-serial's configure (default 4/8)
         does not need mpif.master.h template -> mpif.$FORT_SIZE.h

    so... did i clobber good value of mpif.h ?
