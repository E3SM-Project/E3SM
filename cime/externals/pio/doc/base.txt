\mainpage Parallel I/O library (PIO)

The Parallel I/O (PIO) library has been developed over several years to improve the 
ability of component models of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to perform I/O.  However, we 
believe that the interface is sufficiently general to be useful to a broader spectrum of applications.
Although PIO has a binary output capability the focus of development has been on backend tools that
use the NetCDF file format.   

This user's guide provides information about the PIO library and examples on how it can be used. 
Please review the ChangeLog that is included with the distribution for up-to-date release information.
