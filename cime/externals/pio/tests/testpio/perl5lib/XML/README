XML::Lite

A light-weight, read-only XML parser for small files

This XML parser is written in pure perl and provides basic methods
for most things you need to do with XML files.

It is not dependent on any other modules or external programs for installation.

NOTE that this parser will do many things that you want with XML but 
not everything. It is not a validating parser! It will not handle
international characters (unless run on those systems). Use
at your own risk.
