OVERVIEW

  ./configure will create a Makefile.conf
  If there are problems, look in Makefile.conf.

  Setting PIOARCH will override the default ('conf')
  and make it use the file Makefile.$PIOARCH

  Legacy site files ./configure.old


PATHS

  If you are using pnetcdf or netcdf, you will need to set their paths
  in the environment variables PNETCDF_PATH and/or NETCDF_PATH.  (There
  will be a warning during config if the feature is enabled but the path
  is not set.)


BUILD HELP:
  Try "./configure -help"  for a list of options.


  Example: If configure has trouble finding the correct F90 compiler:
    > ./configure F90=pgf90.

  You can also direct configure through environment variables:
    > setenv F90 xlf90
    > ./configure


PLATFORM NOTES:

  On robin at NCCS, use:
  > ./configure --host=Linux ac_cv_c_bigendian=yes

  On the Cray XT3/XT4 (e.g. jaguar) use:
  > ./configure --host=Linux FC=ftn F90=ftn

  On jazz for g95:
  use .soft key @all-mpich_gm-gcc4.0.2-g95-0.50
  set the environment variable G95_UNBUFFERED_6 to prevent
  truncation of stdout
  > ./configure F90=mpif90

  On Blue Gene/P (BG/P), use:
  > ./configure FC=mpixlf90_r CC=mpixlc_r
