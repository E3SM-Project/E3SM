<para> 
A full description of all driver namelist options are in <ulink
url="../../cesm/doc/modelnl/nl_drv.html">driver namelists</ulink>
There are three important driver/coupler namelist input files
(cpl_modelio.nml, drv_in, and seq_maps.rc)
and each file has at least one namelist input group.  The namelist groups
are modelio, seq_infodata_inparm, seq_timemgr_inparm, ccsm_pes,
prof_inparm, pio_inparm, and seq_maps.  
</para>

<para>
The cpl_modelio.nml file sets the filename for the primary standard
output file.  Existance is largely historical.  Existance is largely
historical.  In CESM1.1, the cpl.buildnml.csh script actually
generates the _modelio.nml files for all components by a call to the
cpl <command>build-namelist</command>.
</para>

<para>
The drv_in input file contains several different namelist groups
associated with general options, time manager options, pe layout,
timing output, and parallel IO settings.  The different groups are
seq_infodata_inparm, seq_timemgr_inparm, ccsm_pes, prof_inparm, and
pio_inparm.  The seq_infodata_inparm_namelists are associated with
some general driver/coupler options.  The seq_maps.rc file specifies
the mapping files for the configuration and is generated by the
cpl.buildnml.csh file.  It is NOT a Fortran namelist file but the
format should be relatively clear from the default settings.
