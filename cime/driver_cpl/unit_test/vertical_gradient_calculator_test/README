The script plot_gradient and the example input file gradient_example.txt are not
directly related to the unit tests here. Rather, this script can be used to plot
the output from a gradient calculator, in a sort of "functional unit testing"
sense.

If you look back at the history of this directory, you'll find some "functional
unit tests" that resulted in output files that could be plotted with this
script. However, these have been deleted because they were testing a vertical
gradient calculator implementation that no longer exists.
