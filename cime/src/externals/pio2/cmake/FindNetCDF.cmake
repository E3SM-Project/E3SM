# This can be controlled by setting the NetCDF_PATH (or, equivalently, the
# NETCDF environment variable), or NetCDF_<lang>_PATH CMake variables, where
# <lang> is the COMPONENT language one needs.
#
# Once done, this will define:
#
#   NetCDF_<lang>_FOUND        (BOOL) - system has NetCDF
#   NetCDF_<lang>_IS_SHARED    (BOOL) - whether library is shared/dynamic
#   NetCDF_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIR  (PATH) - Location of the C header file
#   NetCDF_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS (LIST) - the NetCDF include directories
#   NetCDF_<lang>_LIBRARY      (FILE) - Path to the C library file
#   NetCDF_<lang>_LIBRARIES    (LIST) - link these to use NetCDF
