/** @page netcdf_integration NetCDF API Integration

The netCDF integration feature allows existing netCDF codes, in C or
Fortran, to be easily converted to use PIO.

# Building and Using PIO with NetCDF Integration

In order to use netCDF integration:

* The PIO configure must use the option --enable-netcdf-integration.

* The latest master of the netcdf-c library must be built and used,
and the PIO build must include the netcdf-c/include directory in its
CPPFLAGS, in order to find internal netCDF header files needed for
netCDF integration. (The netcdf-c library is being modified to export
publically everything needed, so future releases of netcdf-c will no
longer require this.)

Once PIO is build for netCDF integration, it provides the nc_* and
nf_* functions required to fully integrate PIO and netCDF.
