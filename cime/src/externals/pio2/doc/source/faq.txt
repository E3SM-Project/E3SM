/*! \page faq Frequently Asked Questions 

Here is a list of frequently asked questions and their answers.
   
<dl>

<dt>How do I specify which tasks perform IO?</dt>

<dd>This is done in the call to \ref PIO_init which has two
interfaces: init_intracom and init_intercom.
    
  <ul>

    <li> In the init_intracom interface, use the num_iotasks and
    stride variables to specify the total number of io tasks and the
    stride between them with respect to the mpi communicator,
    comp_comm, which is provided.  You can also use the optional base
    argument to shift the first IO task away from the first
    computational task, this is often desirable because the
    applications first computational task often has higher memory
    requirements than other tasks.  IO tasks are a subset of the tasks
    defined in comp_comm.

    <li> In the init_intercom interface, IO tasks are a disjoint set
    of tasks from those in the computational communicator.

</ul>

Note that num_iotasks is the maximum number of IO tasks to use for an
IO operation.  The size of the field being read or written along with
the tunable blocksize parameter, \ref PIO_set_blocksize, determines
the actual number of tasks used for a given IO operation.

<dt>How do I test if PIO is installed and working correctly?</dt> 

<dd>The PIO Library distribution contains tests for PIO. They are run
my 'make check'. The tests use mpiexec to run tests on 4, 8, or 16
processors. </dd>
