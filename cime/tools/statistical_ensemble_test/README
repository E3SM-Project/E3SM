CESM-ECT (CESM Ensemble Consistency Test) determines whether a new
simulation set up (new machine, compiler, etc.) is statistically
distinguishable from an accepted ensemble.  The verification tools in
the CESM-ECT suite are:

CAM-ECT - detects issues in CAM and CLM (12 month runs)
UF-CAM-ECT - detects issues in CAM and CLM (9 time step runs)
POP-ECT - detects issues in POP and CICE (12 month runs)

(1) The ECT process involves comparing several runs (3) generated with
the new scenario to an ensemble built on a trusted machine (currently 
cheyenne). The python ECT tools are located in the pyCECT
subdirectory or https://github.com/NCAR/PyCECT/releases.

Before the test can be run, a summary file is needed of the ensemble
runs to which the comparison will be made. Ensemble summary files
(NetCDF) for existing tags for CAM-ECT, UF-CAM-ECT and POP-ECT that
were created by CSEG are located (respectively) in the CESM input data
directories:

$CESMDATAROOT/inputdata/validation/ensembles
$CESMDATAROOT/inputdata/validation/uf_ensembles
$CESMDATAROOT/inputdata/validation/pop_ensembles

(2) If a new ensemble (and summary file) needs to be created, the
ensemble.sh script in this directory can first be used (see
'ensemble.sh -h' for additional details) to create the ensemble. This
script creates and compiles a case, then creates clones of the
original case, with the pertlim in user_nl_cam is slightly modified
for each ensemble member.  At this time, cime includes functionality
to create ensembles for CAM-ECT and UF-CAM-ECT (UF-POP-ECT coming
soon).

For example, for CAM-ECT:

./ensemble.sh --case /glade/scratch/cesm_user/cesm_tag/ensemble/ensemble.cesm_tag.000 --mach cheyenne --compset F2000 --res f19_f19 --compiler intel --ensemble 151

For example, for UF-CAM-ECT:

./ensemble.sh --case /glade/scratch/cesm_user/cesm_tag/uf_ensemble/ensemble.cesm_tag.uf.000 --mach cheyenne --compset F2000 --res f19_f19 --compiler intel --ensemble 350 --uf

Notes: -case name must end in ".000"
       -ensemble size must be specified, suggested defaults are 151 
       for CAM-ECT and 350 for UF-CAM-ECT. Note that the ensemble size
       needs to be larger than the number of variables that ECT will
       evaluate.	    	

Once all ensemble simulations have run successfully, copy every cam.h0
history file from each ensemble run directory into a separate directory. Next
create the ensemble summary using the pyCECT tool pyEnsSum.py (see
README_pyEnsSum.rst).

(3) Once an ensemble summary file has been created or chosen to
use from $CESMDATAROOT/inputdata/validation, the three simulation
runs to be verified by ECT must be created via script ensemble.sh.

It is important that the same resolution and compset be used in the
individual runs as in the ensemble.  The NetCDF ensemble summary file global
attributes give this information.
	   	
For example, for CAM-ECT:

./ensemble.sh --case /glade/scratch/cesm_user/cesm_tag/case.cesm_tag.000 --mach cheyenne --compset F2000 --res f19_f19 --compiler intel 

For example, for UF-CAM-ECT:

./ensemble.sh --case /glade/scratch/cesm_user/cesm_tag/case.cesm_tag.uf.000 --mach cheyenne --compset F2000 --res f19_f19 --compiler intel --uf

Once all three simulations have run successfully, copy the cam.h0
history file from each run directory into a separate directory. Next
verify the new simulations with the pyCECT tool pyCECT.py (see
README_pyCECT.rst).
