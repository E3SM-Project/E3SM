=============
CESM Ensemble Consistency Test
------------------------------
The CESM-ECT package is used to compare the results of a set of new (modified)
CESM simulations against the accepted ensemble.  Current functionality includes 
CAM-ECT, which examines history files from CAM (atmosphere) or POP-ECT which 
examines files from POP (ocean).  CAM-ECT requires 
a summary file generated by pyEnsSum.py (see README.pyEnsSum), and POP-ECT 
requires  a summary file generated by pyEnsSumPop.py (see README.pyEnsSumPop).
An overall pass or fail is designated.

Overview
--------
This package includes:

       pyCECT.py
                            A script which compares the new CAM or POP results to the 
                            accepted ensemble and issues an overall "pass" or "fail"
			    (runs CAM-ECT by default or POP-ECT if specified)

       pyEnsLib.py         Library python script used by pyCECT.py


Before you start to use the package, you need to load the following modules:

       - module load python
       - module load numpy
       - module load scipy
       - module load pynio

To see all options (and defaults):

       python pyCECT.py -h

Notes and examples:
--------------------------------------------

(A) Options for all CESM-ECT approaches:

     Required:

         To specify the summary file generated by pyEnsSum.py:
	    -sumfile  ens.summary.nc

     	 To specifying the directory path that contains the run(s) to be evaluated:
	    -indir  /glade/u/tdd/asap/verification/cesm1_3_beta11/mira

    Optional:
	 Verbose information:
	     --verbose

(B) CAM-ECT specific options (and summary file generated by pyEnsSum.py)

    Note that CAM-ECT is the default test.

    Note that the parameters setting the pass/fail criteria are all set by 
    default (ie. sigMul, minPCFail, minRunFail, numRunFile, and nPC).  But 
    if the specified indir contains more files than the number (num) specified by 
    "--numRunFile <num>"  (default= 3), then <num> files will be chosen at random 
    from that directory.

    To enable printing of extra variable information:
       --printVarTest

    By default, CAM-ECT looks at annual averages which is indictated by 

       --timeslice 1  (For monthly files, --timeslice 0.  Note that this 
       should correspond to what has been collected in the summary file.)

    Example using the default settings:
    
    python pyCECT.py --sumfile  CAM.ens.summary.nc --indir  /glade/u/tdd/asap/verification/cesm1_3_beta11/mira 
         

 (C) POP-ECT specific options (and summary file generated by pyEnsSumPop.py)
      
      To use POP-ECT, you MUST add the following to enable this test (which disables CAM-ECT):

           --popens 

      Be sure to use a POP-ECT summary file:
           
	   --sumfile /glade/u/tdd/asap/pop_verification/ens_sum/pop.40ens.openseas.nc
	    
      Directory path that contains the run(s) to be evaluated.
	    
	   --indir /glade/u/tdd/asap/pop_verification/testcases/

      The above directory may contain many POP history files that following the standard 
      CESM-POP naming convention. To specific with file or files you wish to test, you 
      simply specifying the test case file prefix.  For  example, to compare against all 
      months in year 3 from the input directory above:

            --input_glob cvtd100000.0.pop.h.0003
           
      To compare only against month 6 in year 3:

            --input_glob cvtd100000.0.pop.h.0003-06
         
     Be sure to specify the json file that includes the variables which will be run the test on:

            --jsonfile pop_ensemble.json

    Note that the parameters setting the pass/fail criteria are all set by 
    default (ie. pop_tol, pop_threshold) but may be modified:

         Specifying test tolerance (the minimum Z-score threshold):

            --pop_tol 3.0

    	 Specifying pop threshold (fraction of points that must satisfy the Z-score tolerance):
 
            --pop_threshold 0.9

    To run in parallel (recommended if you are analyzing more than one month - one core per month):

            --mpi_enable
    
    Example:
         
    python pyCECT.py --sumfile /glade/u/tdd/asap/pop_verification/ens_sum/pop.40ens.openseas.nc --indir /glade/u/tdd/asap/pop_verification/testcases/ --input_glob cvtd100000.0.pop.h.0003 --popens --jsonfile pop_ensemble.json  --pop_tol 3.0 --pop_threshold 0.9
