HOW TO BUILD
============

Prior to building, you must make sure $CIMEROOT is set.

(1) $ cd src
(2) $ $CIMEROOT/tools/configure -mach [machine name]
(3) Bash users:
    $ . .env_mach_specific.sh
    csh users:
    $ source .env_mach_specific.csh
(4) $ gmake

Note: in the second step, replace [machine name] with the machine you are
building on. Also, some machines have dedicated build nodes, so you might need
to SSH to another node before the 'gmake' step.
