ABOUT THIS TOOL
===============

The src/ directory here contains F90 files and a Makefile to produce the
runoff_map executable, which reads in a runoff file and an ocean grid file
and outputs a map from the former to the latter:

1) Computes an initial nearest neighbor mapping from the rof grid cells to
   active ocean grid cells.
2) Computes a smoothing matrix on the ocean grid.
3) The two matrices are multipled together to generate the final mapping file.

====================
HOW TO USE THIS TOOL
====================

1) Build (in the src/ directory)
2) Setup a namelist file (runoff_map.nml)
3) Run ./runoff_map

HOW TO BUILD
============

See INSTALL file in this directory

====================
NAMELIST FILE FORMAT
====================

The namelist file must be called "runoff_map.nml".  That name is hardwired
into the executable.

The namelist looks like this

  &input_nml
   gridtype     = 'scrip'
   file_roff    = '/glade/p/cesm/cseg/mapping/grids/wr50a_090614.nc'
   file_ocn     = '/glade/p/cesm/cseg/mapping/grids/ar9v4_100920.nc'
   file_nn      = 'map_wr50a_ar9v4_nn.nc '
   file_smooth  = 'map_ar9v4_ar9v4_smoother.nc '
   file_new     = 'map_wr50a_to_ar9v4_e1000r300_130507.nc'
   title        = 'runoff map: wr50a -> ar9v4, smoothed '
   eFold        = 1000000.0
   rMax         =  300000.0
   step1 = .true.
   step2 = .false.
   step3 = .false.
  /

where

Input grid files:
  file_roff =   an ascii rdirc file OR an obs rtm file OR a scrip grid file
  gridtype  =  type of file_roff file, "rtm" or "obs" or "scrip"
     rtm is a 720 x 360 grid ascii file
     obs is a netcdf file with xc, yc, xv, yv, mask and area variable names
     scrip is a scrip type grid file (must contain grid_area along with typical
       scrip grid variables)
  file_ocn  =  a scrip ocean grid file (must contain grid_area along with
    typical scrip grid variables)

Input parameters:
  eFold  = smoothing eFold distance in meters
  rMax   = maximum radius of effect in meters

Settings:
  title = ascii string to add to mapping files
  step1 = computes nearest neighbor map
  step2 = computes smooth map
  step3 = multiple two maps together

Output fields:
  file_nn     = nearest neighbor mapping file
  file_smooth = smoother mapping file
  file_new    = combined file


==========
HOW TO RUN
==========

Execute the binary ./runoff_map (again, this will read the runoff_map.nml
namelist file - see above section for tips on creating the file)
