HOW TO BUILD
============

Prior to building, you must make sure environment variables CIMEROOT and CIME_MODEL are set.

(1) $ cd src
(2) $ $CIMEROOT/tools/configure --machine [machine name] --macros-format Makefile
(3) Bash users:
    $ . .env_mach_specific.sh
    csh users:
    $ source .env_mach_specific.csh
(4) $ gmake

Note: in the second step, replace [machine name] with the machine you are
building on. Also, some machines have dedicated build nodes, so you might need
to SSH to another node before the 'gmake' step.
