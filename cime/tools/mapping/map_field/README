ABOUT THIS TOOL
===============

The src/ directory here contains an F90 file and a Makefile to produce the
map_fields executable, which reads in a mapping file and input field and
maps that field to an output file.

============
HOW TO BUILD
============

See INSTALL file in this directory

==========
HOW TO RUN
==========

$ map_field -m <filemap>
            -if <input_file>
            -iv <input_varname>
            -of <output_file>
            -ov <output_varname>
           [-c <user comment map_field.nml>]

where:
    filemap = input mapping file name  (character string)
    input_file = input file name
    input_varname = input variable name
    output_file = output file name
    output_varname = output variable name
    usercomment = optional, netcdf global attribute (character string)

The following files are read
  filemap
  input_file
The following files are created
  output_file

=======
EXAMPLE
=======

To build:

> cd src
> setenv CIMEROOT ~/cime1_1_0
> $CIMEROOT/machines/configure -mach yellowstone
> gmake
> cd ../

To run:

> ./map_field -m "/glade/p/cesm/cseg/inputdata/cpl/cpl6/map_ar9v4_to_wr50a_aave_da_110107.nc" -if "/glade/u/home/tcraig/racm_masks_121108.nc" -iv POP_MASK -of x1.nc -ov atm_pop_frac

=====
NOTES
=====

(a) The output file is ALWAYS CLOBBERED in the current implementation.

(b) There is limited error checking at this time.
