## Examples Included with PIO Distribution

The PIO library examples can be found under the examples
subdirectory. They are built with the make test or make check build
target.

### C Examples

The C examples are in the examples/c subdirectory.

- examplePio.c A simple example showing a write, then read, of a 1D variable.

- example1.c Another simple example showing a write, then read, of a
  1D variable. This produces the same output as examplePio.c.

- example2.c This example writes a 3D floating point variable, with an
  unlimited dimension. The data are written in slices along the
  unlimited dimension. This example also incorporates (if installed)
  the MPE profiling system to generate graphical output.

### Fortran Examples

The Fortran examples are in the examples/f03 subdirectory.

- examplePio.f90 A simple example showing a write, then read, of a 1D variable.

  PIO has been implemented in several geophysical component models, including the 
Community Atmosphere Model (CAM), the Community Land Model (CLM), the Parallel Ocean Program 
(POP), the Community Ice CodE (CICE), and coupler for used by CCSM4.0 (CPL7).  We also provide 
several simpler example code as well as a test code that is suitable for regression testing and 
benchmarking.
