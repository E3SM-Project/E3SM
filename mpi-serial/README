mpi-serial


this library provides a one-processor version of MPI.

in particular it supports MPI_Send, MPI_Receive, MPI_Isend,
MPI_Ireceive, MPI_Test, MPI_Wait*, and most collective
calls like MPI_Reduce, MPI_Gather, MPI_Scatter, etc.


INSTALLATION:

'make' to compile the library.
'make clean' to get rid of everything.


the C interface should be very portable.

in rare cases the fortran constants in mpif.h may need to be changed.
there are checks at runtime (withing MPI_Init) and if any are
bad there will be an error message.  so just try it first as-is.
