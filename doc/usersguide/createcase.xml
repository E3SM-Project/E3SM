CESM supports out of the box <ulink
url="../modelnl/compsets.html">component sets</ulink>, <ulink
url="../modelnl/grid.html">model grids</ulink> and <ulink
url="../modelnl/machines.html">hardware platforms</ulink>.  Component
sets (usually referred to as compsets) define both the specific model
components that will be used in a given &cesm; configuration,
<emphasis>and</emphasis> any component-specific namelist or
configuration settings that are specific to this configuration.  In
the CESM1.2 release series (starting with CESM1.2.0) component sets
and resolutions have been significantly changed to permit addressing
the growing model complexity. Both compsets and models grids are now
associated with three names: a new longname, a new short name (that is
backwards compatible with the older CESM1.1 release series long name)
and a new alias name (that is backwards compatible with the older
CESM1.1 release series short name).
</para>

<sect2 id="compset_names">
<title>New Component Set Naming Convention</title>
<para> The new component set (compset) longname has the form 
<screen>
TIME_ATM[%phys]_LND[%phys]_ICE[%phys]_OCN[%phys]_ROF[%phys]_GLC[%phys]_WAV[%phys][_BGC%phys]

TIME = model time period (e.g. 2000, 20TR, RCP8...)   
ATM  = [CAM4, CAM5, DATM, SATM, XATM]	   
LND  = [CLM40, CLM45, DLND, SLND, XLND]	   
ICE  = [CICE, DICE, SICE, SICE]		   
OCN  = [POP2, DOCN, SOCN, XOCN,AQUAP]	   
ROF  = [RTM, DROF, SROF, XROF]		   
GLC  = [CISM1, SGLC, XGLC]			   
WAV  = [SWAV, XWAV]				   
BGC  = optional BGC scenario                    

The OPTIONAL %phys attributes specify sub-modes of the given system
For example DOCN%DOM is the  DOCN data ocean (rather than slab-ocean) mode.
ALL the possible %phys choices for each component are listed 
by the calling create_newcase with the -list compsets argument.
ALL data models now have a %phys option that corresponds to the data
model mode 
</screen>
</para><para>
As an example, the new longname,
20TR_CAM4_CLM40%CN_CICE_POP2_RTM_SGLC_SWAV, refers to running the
prognostic components CAM, CLM, RTM, CICE, POP2 with stubs SGLC and
SWAV components.  The particular configuration will be a transient 1850 to 2000
run using cam5 physics, clm4.0 physics with clm4.0 cn,
prognostic cice (default) and pop2 (default).  The shortname and alias
for this compset are now B_1850-2000_CAM5_CN and B20TRC5CN, which
correspond to the CESM1.1 series longname and shortname, respectively.
<emphasis>Any one of the three compset names </emphasis>(longname, shortname or
alias) can be used as input to &create_newcase;.  It is now also
much easier to create your own custom compset (see <link
linkend="faq_createowncompset">How do I create my own
compset?</link>). All the out-of-the-box CESM1.2 release series
compsets are listed in <ulink url="../modelnl/compsets.html">component
sets</ulink>. Upon clicking on any of the long names a pop up box will
appear that provides more details of the component configuration.

<sect2 id="grid_names"> 
<title>New Overall Model Grid Naming Convention</title>
<para> The new model grid longname has the form

a%name_l%name_oi%name_r%name_m%mask_g%name_w%name

a%  = atmosphere grid

From the point of view of model coupling - the glc (CISM) grid is assumed to
be identical to the land grid. However, the internal CISM grid can be different,

<para>
As an example, the new longname,

running an ne30np4 spectral element 1-degree atmosphere and land grids
a gx1v6 Greenland pole 1-degree ocean and sea-ice grids a 1/2 degree
river routing grid, null wave and internal cism grids and an
ocean/land mask that is determined by the gx1v6 ocean mask.  The
shortname and alias for this grid are now ne30np4_gx1v6 and ne30_g16,

<para>
Component grids (such as the atmosphere grid or ocean grid above) are
denoted by the following naming convention:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>"[dlat]x[dlon]" are regular lon/lat finite volume
grids where dlat and dlon are the approximate grid spacing.  The
shorthand convention is "fnn" where nn is generally a pair of numbers
indicating the resolution.  An example is 1.9x2.5 or f19 for the
approximately "2-degree" finite volume grid.  Note that CAM uses an
[nlat]x[nlon] naming convection internally for this
grid. </para></listitem>

<listitem><para>"Tnn" are spectral lon/lat grids where nn is the
spectral truncation value for the resolution.  The shorthand name is
identical. An example is T85.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>"ne[X]np[Y]" are cubed sphere resolutions where X and
Y are integers.  The short name is generally ne[X].  An example is
ne30np4 or ne30.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>"pt1" is a single grid point.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>"gx[D]v[n]" is a displaced pole grid where D is the
approximate resolution in degrees and n is the grid version.  The
short name is generally g[D][n].  An example is gx1v6 or g16 for a
grid of approximately 1-degree resolution.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>"tx[D]v[n]" is a tripole grid where D is the approximate resolution
in degrees and n is the grid version. </para></listitem>

<title>Using create_newcase</title>
<para> 
You should first use the -h option in calling &create_newcase; to
document its input options.  In addition, the &create_newcase; -list
[compsets,grids,machine] option can also be used to see which
component sets, model grids, and machines are supported. The links
above, however, provide a much more complete determination.
&create_newcase; can be called with the following arguments:
</para>

     [-verbose [or -v]] \
     [-xmlmode [normal, expert]] \
     [-nowarning]      
</screen>

<para>Required arguments to &create_newcase; are -case, -mach, -compset and -res.
If you want to use your own pes setup file, specify the full
pathname of that file for the optional -pes_file argument. The
required pes_file format is provided at
<filename>$CCSMROOT/scripts/sample_pes_file.xml</filename>. 
</para>

<para> 
Following is a simple example of using &create_newcase;: In what
follows, $&CCSMROOT; is the full pathname of the root directory of the
CESM distribution. 
<screen> 
> cd $&CCSMROOT;/scripts 
> create_newcase -case ~/cesm/example1 \ 
  -compset B_1850_CAM5_CN \ 
  -res ne30np4_gx1v6 \
  -mach yellowstone
</screen>
</para>

<para>
This example creates a $&CASEROOT; directory
<filename>~/cesm1/example1</filename> where $&CASE; is "example1" with
a model resolution of 0.9x1.25_gx1v6 (a 1-degree atmosphere/land grid
with a nominal 1-degree ocean/ice grid using the gx1v6 ocean
mask). The component set B_1850_CN uses fully active components
configured to produce a present-day simulation.  The complete example
appears in the <link linkend="use_case_basic">basic
example</link>. $&CASE; can include letters, numbers, ".", and "_".
Note that &create_newcase; creates the $&CASEROOT; directory. If the
directory already exists, it prints a warning and aborts. 
</para>

<para>
As a more general description, &create_newcase; creates the directory
$&CASEROOT;, which is specified by the -case option. In $&CASEROOT;,
&create_newcase; installs files to build and run the model and perform
long term archiving of the case on the target platform.
&create_newcase; also creates the directory
<filename>$CASEROOT/Buildconf/</filename>, that in turn contains
scripts to generate component namelist and build component libraries.

<sect2 id="case_conf_setting_pes">
<title>Changing the PE layout </title>

<para> 
<ulink url="../modelnl/env_mach_pes.html">&env_mach_pes.xml</ulink>
variables determine the number of processors for each component, the
number of instances of each component and the layout of the components
across the hardware processors.  Optimizing the throughput and
efficiency of a &cesm; experiment often involves customizing the
processor (PE) layout for <link
linkend="running_ccsm_loadbalance">load balancing</link>.  CESM has
significant flexibility with respect to the layout of components
across different hardware processors. In general, the &cesm;
components -- atm, lnd, ocn, ice, glc, rof, and cpl -- can run on
overlapping or mutually unique processors. Whereas Each component is
associated with a unique MPI communicator, the driver runs on the
union of all processors and controls the sequencing and hardware
partitioning. The component processor layout is via three settings:
the number of MPI tasks, the number of OpenMP threads per task, and
the root MPI processor number from the global set.</para>

<para>For example, the following &env_mach_pes.xml; settings</para>

<screen>
&lt;entry id="NTASKS_OCN" value="128" /&gt;
&lt;entry id="NTHRDS_OCN" value="1" /&gt;
&lt;entry id="ROOTPE_OCN" value="0" /&gt;
</screen>
<para>
would cause the ocean component to run on
128 hardware processors with 128 MPI tasks using one
thread per task starting from global MPI task 0 (zero).
</para>
<para>In this next example: </para>
<screen>
&lt;entry id="NTASKS_ATM" value="16" /&gt;
&lt;entry id="NTHRDS_ATM" value="4"  /&gt;
&lt;entry id="ROOTPE_ATM" value="32" /&gt;
</screen>
<para>
the atmosphere component will run on 64 hardware processors using 16
MPI tasks and 4 threads per task starting at global MPI task 32.
There are NTASKS, NTHRDS, and ROOTPE input variables for every
component in &env_mach_pes.xml;.  There are some important things
to note.</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>
NTASKS must be greater or equal to 1 (one) even for inactive (stub) components.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
NTHRDS must be greater or equal to 1 (one).  If NTHRDS is set to 1, this
generally means threading parallelization will be off for that component.
NTHRDS should never be set to zero.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The total number of hardware processors allocated to a component is
NTASKS * NTHRDS.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The coupler processor inputs specify the pes used by coupler 
computation such as mapping, merging, diagnostics, and flux
calculation.  This is distinct from the driver which always 
automatically runs on the union
of all processors to manage model concurrency and sequencing.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The root processor is set relative to the MPI global communicator, not the
hardware processors counts.  An example of this is below.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
The layout of components on processors has no impact on the science.
The scientific sequencing is hardwired into the driver.  Changing 
processor layouts does not change intrinsic coupling lags or coupling
sequencing.  ONE IMPORTANT POINT is that for a fully 
active configuration, the atmosphere component is hardwired in the driver to 
never run concurrently with the land or ice component.  Performance 
improvements associated with processor layout concurrency is therefore
constrained in this case such that there is never a performance reason
not to overlap the atmosphere component with the land and ice components.
Beyond that constraint, the land, ice, coupler and ocean models can
run concurrently, and the ocean model can also run concurrently with the 
atmosphere model.  
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>
If all components have identical NTASKS, NTHRDS, and ROOTPE
set, all components will run sequentially on the same hardware
processors.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>The root processor is set relative to the MPI global
communicator, not the hardware processor counts.
For instance, in the following example:</para>

<screen>
&lt;entry id="NTASKS_ATM" value="16" /&gt;
&lt;entry id="NTHRDS_ATM" value="4"  /&gt;
&lt;entry id="ROOTPE_ATM" value="0"  /&gt;
&lt;entry id="NTASKS_OCN" value="64" /&gt;
&lt;entry id="NTHRDS_OCN" value="1"  /&gt;
&lt;entry id="ROOTPE_OCN" value="16" /&gt;
</screen>

<para>
the atmosphere and ocean are running concurrently, each on 64
processors with the atmosphere running on MPI tasks 0-15 and the ocean
running on MPI tasks 16-79. The first 16 tasks are each threaded 4
ways for the atmosphere. The batch submission script ($CASE.run)
should automatically request 128 hardware processors, and the first 16
MPI tasks will be laid out on the first 64 hardware processors with a
stride of 4. The next 64 MPI tasks will be laid out on the second set
of 64 hardware processors.
</para>

<para>
If you set ROOTPE_OCN=64 in the preceding example, then a total of
176 processors would have been requested and the atmosphere would
have been laid out on the first 64 hardware processors in 16x4
fashion, and the ocean model would have been laid out
on hardware processors 113-176. Hardware processors 65-112 would

<title>Multi-instance component functionality</title>

<para> Like the CESM1.1 series, the CESM1.2 series also has the
new capability to run multiple component instances under one model
executable.  The only caveat to this usage is that if N multiple
instances of any one active component is used, then N multiple
instances of ALL active components are required. More details are
discussed below. The primary motivation for this development was to be
able to run an ensemble Kalman-Filter for data assimilation and
parameter estimation (e.g. UQ).  However, it also provides you with
the ability to run a set of experiments within a single CESM
executable where each instance can have a different namelist, and have
all the output go to one directory.</para>

<para> In the following an F compset will be used as an
illustration. Utilizing the multiple instance code involves the
following steps: </para>

For an F compset, only atm, lnd, rof are full prognostic components.
The ocn is a prescribed data component, cice is a mixed
prescribed/prognostic component (ice-coverage is prescribed) and glc
and wav are stub components.
Lets say we want to run 2 instances of CAM in this experiment. The
current implementation of multi-instances will also require you to run
2 instances of CLM, CICE and RTM. However, you have the flexibility to run either 1
or 2 instances of DOCN (we can ignore glc and wav since they do not do
anything in this compset). To run 2 instances of CAM, CLM, CICE, RTM and DOCN, all you
need to do is to change NINST_ATM, NINST_LND, NINST_ICE, NINST_ROF and NINST_DOCN above from 1 to 2.
This will result in the following &env_mach_pes.xml; file:
