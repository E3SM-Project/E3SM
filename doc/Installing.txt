 */ /*! \page install Installing PIO

<ol>
<li>Download the code from the following Google code subversion location:

> http://parallelio.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
</li>

<li>Configure - PIO uses the gnu autoconf tools, for historical reasons the configure
script is in the pio subdirectory.  A complete set of configure arguments, options and flags is available by running:

> configure --help.   

Before running configure, you will need to know the location of some supporting libraries. 

- Set the NETCDF_PATH environment variable to the netcdf install directory or --disable-netcdf to
disable serial NetCDF support.

- Use the flag --enable-netcdf4 to enable the NetCDF4/HDF5 parallel interface.

- Set the PNETCDF_PATH environment variable to the pnetcdf install directory, This will enable support
for parallel-netcdf

- Set the CC, FC, MPICC, and MPIFC environment variables to the serial and parallel C and Fortran 90 compiler names.

This should be the minimal set of flags required to build pio.

One additional flag of interest is --enable-filesystem-hints which can
be set to gpfs or lustre.  You should only use this flag if you are sure that the
file system you are using is either gpfs or lustre respectively. (ASB - what it you don't know? does it matter if this flag is set or not?)  </li>

<li>After configure completes use gmake in the pio subdirectory to complete the build.   

> gmake

Note that although the user application only needs to 'use pio'  at least some compilers require that
all of the module files be located in the install directory. If that is the case, then running

> gmake install 

will move the compiled library and module files to the directory specified
by $PREFIX which can be set by using the --prefix argument to configure.   </li>
</ol>
