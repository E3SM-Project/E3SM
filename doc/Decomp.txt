On of the biggest challenges to working with PIO is setting up 
the call to \ref PIO_initdecomp.  The user must properly describe the 
how data within each MPI tasks memory should be placed or retrieved from 
disk. PIO provides several interfaces. We describe the simplest interface 
first and then progress to the most complex and flexible interface.  

\section decomp_bc Block-cyclic interface

The simplest inteface assumes that your arrays are decomposed in a block-cyclic 
structure and can be described simply using a start-count type approach. 
A simple block-cyclic decomposition for a 1-dimension (1D)  array is illustrated in Figure 3.1. 
Note that contigious layout of the data in memory can be easily mapped to a contigious 
layout on disk. The \em start arguments corresponds to the starting point of the block of contigious 
memory, while the \em count is the number of words.  Note that \em start and \em count must be arrays of length 
equal to the dimensionality of the distributed array.  While we use a 1D array for simplicity, PIO 
currently supports up to 5-dimension (5D) arrays. In the case of 5D arrays, the start and count arrays 
would be of length 5.

We next provide the call to \ref PIO_initdecomp that  would necessary implement the decomposition illustrated in Figure 1.   
The variable \em iosystem is created by the call to \ref PIO_init.  The second argument \em PIO_double is the PIO kind, and
indicates that this is a decomposition for a 8-byte real.  For a list of supported kinds see \ref PIO_kinds.  The argument \em dims is the global dimension for the array.  The \em start and \em count arrays are 8-byte integers of type PIO_OFFSET, while \em iodesc is the IO descriptor generated by the call to PIO_initdecomp.

\verbinclude simple-bc

\section rearr Controling IO decomposition

The above example represents the simplest way to initialize and use PIO to write out and read distributed arrays.  PIO however provides some additnnoal features that allows greater control over the IO process.  In particular, it provides the ability to define an IO decomposition. Note that a user defined IO decomposition is optional.  If one is not provided and rearrangement is necessary, PIO will internally compute a IO decomposition.  We describe the reason a IO decomposition my be necessary in Sectiom \ref decomp_dof.   This flexibility provides the ability define an intermediate decomposition that is unique from the computational decomposition.  This IO decomposition could be constructed as to maximize the write or read performance to the disk subsystem.  We extend the
simple example in Figure 1 to include an IO decomposition in Figure 1b.

In Figure 1b we illustrate the creation of an IO decomposition on two of the MPI tasks. For this decomposition the 8 word array 
is evenly distributed between PE 0 and PE 2. The arrows in Figure 1b indicates rearrangement that is performed within the PIO library.  In this 
case PE 0 sends an word to PE 2 while PE 1 sends two words to PE 0.  The rearranged array in the IO decomposition is subsequently written to disk.  
Note that in this case, only two of three MPI tasks are performing writes to disk. PIO allows the user to specify the IO decomposition using the 
optional parameters \em iostart and \em iocount. The following bit of code for PE 0 illustrates the necessary call to \ref PIO_initdecomp.  

\verbinclude simple-bc-rearr  

\section decomp_dof Degree of freedom interface

The interface described in Section \ref decomp_bc, while simple and used by both pNetCDF (http://trac.mcs.anl.gov/projects/parallel-netcdf) and NetCDF-4 (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is 
frequencly insufficient for applications with non-trivial decompositions. While it is possible to use use multiple calls to construct a file with a non-trivial decomposition 
the performance penalty is frequently significant.   PIO therefore 
provides a more general interface to \ref PIO_initdecomp based on the degree of freedom concept. Each word within the distributed array must be given a unique 
value that corresponds to its order placement in the file on disk.  So the first word in the file on disk has a dof of 1, the second 2, etc.  This allows a fully 
general specification of the decomposition.  We illustrate its use Figure 2.  Note that in Figure 2, PE 0 and PE 1 do not contain contiguous pieces of the distributed array. 
The desired order on disk must be specified using the the compDOF argument to \ref PIO_initdecomp.  In 
this case PE 0 contains the 2nd, 4th, and 5th element of the array, PE 1 contains the 1st and 3rd, and 
PE 2 contains the 6th, 7th, and 8th elements of the array.  The integer compDOF arrays for each MPI task 
is illustrated at the bottom of Figure 2.

The call to \ref PIO_initdecomp which implements Figure 2 on PE 0 is provided below.  

\verbinclude simple-dof

As with the block-cyclic interface the degree of freedom interface provides the ability to specify the io decomposition through optional arguments to \ref PIO_initdecomp.

Figure 2 illustrates the inclusion of an io decomposition and associated rearrangement to write out the distributed array.   The subroutine call to \ref PIO_initdecomp is illustrated below:

\ref PIO_initdecomp interface. In particular you will need to set the computatinal degree's of freedom.
The computational degree's of freedom, the arguement compDOF in the \ref PIO_initdecomp are illustrated in Figure 2.
