\page error Error Handling

By default PIO handles errors internally by printing a string
describing the error and then calling mpi_abort.  Application
developers can change this behaivior with a call to
\ref PIO_seterrorhandling

For example if a developer wanted
to see if an input netcdf file contained the variable 'U' they might do the following

\verbinclude errorhandle

\ref PIO_error_method
