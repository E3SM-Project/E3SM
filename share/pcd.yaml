# Physical Constants Dictionary (PCD)
#
# This YAML file contains a dictionary of physical constants. The constants are grouped
# in categories, such as mathematical (like pi), universal physical constants (such as
# the Boltzman constant), water properties, and more. Each constant in these groups
# provides important data and metadata, such as name, units, uncertainty, a reference,
# and more. More details can be found in the upstream project github documentation:
