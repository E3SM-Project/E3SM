A  +            -   pio_msg_callbacks.F90
A  +            -   pio_msg_getput_callbacks.F90.in
      The subroutines in these files are the interface between the disjoint io tasks
	and the pio functions, to avoid circular dependencies they are not written in
	module form.   Each subroutine collects the input arguments from the compute
	tasks and calls the requested function.  Communication of function outputs back to the 
	compute tasks happens within the function so no post call clean up is required.
	
A  +            -   pio_msg_mod.F90
       This module contains the loop in which the disjoint io tasks wait for requests from 
	compute tasks.  Multiple compute communicators with distinct iosystem descripters are
	supported.   

	
A  +            -   dtypes.h
	Move type macros to an include file to be shared by multiple pio internal files

One-line Summary: Blue Gene specific optimization 

List all subroutines eliminated:
     Removed the Makefile.conf.bluefire and changed testpio_run.pl so that configure is

List all subroutines added and what they do:

	 used by PIO.
    
     nextlarger: Calculates the next larger value which even divides an input arguement.


     determineiotasks:  A special routine only for Blue Gene which will load balance 
	io-tasks accross IO-nodes

     identity:	A Blue Gene specific routine which prints out node identity
      
List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

    pio/configure.ac

	Added CFLAGS to configure stdout 
   
    pio/pio_types.F90
	
	Moved ioranks array into type declaration.  This is a 
	necessary generalization because we no longer have even 
	strides for the IO ranks.  

    pio/piolib_mod.F90

        getiostartandcount has been generallized the provide more 
	functionality including:

	   - Block decomposition in the z-dimension 
	   - A fan-in/out limiter for the decomposition creation loop   	
       
        PIO_inidecomp_dof has been modified to call determineiotasks 
	if on a Blue Gene system 

	add BGP and BGL ifdef

    pio/Makefile 

	Includes the Blue Gene specific topology.c file

    pio/box_rearrange.F90.in

	Removed assumption about a fixed io-stride in the box rearranger

    pio/pio.F90

	exported public PIO_getnumiotasks subroutine 
	

    testpio/testpio_build.pl

	Exported ALLCFLAGS


    testpio/tstpio.F90

	Added test which only allocates arrays if they are used by the code.  
	
	Added the option to do 2-phase pass to measure performance.  The 
	first phase writes out all files, while the second phase will read all 
	files.  This 2-phase approach does a better job of filtering out the 
	impact of read-caching on performance measurements. 

	Fixed the diagnostic which prints out the location of the maximum memory usage

     testpio/testpio_run.pl 

	Added the new testsuite 'bench'

     testpio/build_defaults.xml 

	updated the version of pnetcdf on frost

One-line Summary: handshaking for cray

List all subroutines eliminated: 

List all subroutines added and what they do:  pnetcdf_version_check
	 check that the pnetcdf version is new enough for pio

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

  pio_spmd_utils.F90.in
        - Minor clean-up.

  pio_support.F90.in
    - Introduced of a new routine PIO_FC_GATHER_INT
    - Replaced call to MPI_GATHER in pio_writedof with a call to PIO_FC_GATHER_INT
    - Added handshaking messages to point-to-point gather-like operation in pio_writedof, enabled by the CPP flag _USE_FLOW_CONTROL. Without this flag, the original logic is executed.

	I do not know if the original MPI_GATHER call was causing
	problems, but gathers have become a red flag to me. If the CPP
	flag _USE_FLOW_CONTROL is not defined, then PIO_FC_GATHER_INT
	defaults to a call to MPI_GATHER. Defining _USE_FLOW_CONTROL
	enables the point-to-point implementation with flow control. I
	originally put this new routine in pio_spmd_utils, but circular
	module dependencies forced me to put it here.

   box_rearrange.F90.in

     - Added the following to the module preamble:

#ifdef _USE_FLOW_CONTROL
#define _USE_COMP2IO_FC 1
#define _USE_IO2COMP_FC 1
#define _USE_CREATE_FC 1
#endif

     - Minor clean-ups: renamed USESPACE to be _USE_SPACE, introduced more consistent spacing in subroutine calls, assignments, etc.

     - Introduced replacement implementations of the routines BOX_REARRANGE_CREATE and COMPUTE_COUNTS when _USE_FLOW_CONTROL is defined.

        The new BOX_REARRANGE_CREATE uses PIO_FC_GATHER_INT. The new
	COMPUTE_COUNTS uses SWAPM. The memory requirements are similar to
	the USESPACE branch in the original code, which is the default as
	far as I can tell. (The comments are a little confusing.) The
	performance of the MPI communication logic should be reasonable in
	the new implementations. Any extra cost will come from the memory
	requirements (allocate/assignment/deallocate). Since this is
	similar to what is used in USESPACE, I doubt that we will notice
	any difference.

   Disabled timing tests in frost test suite - the timing library needs a few changes 
	to work on frost
   Replaced getiostartandcount with an algorithm provided by Tony, this is doing a better
	job of decomposing into optimal strips
   Relaxed an error condition in box_rearranger that required the size of the comp location
	to be equal to the size of the dof.  We now require that the comp location is >= the
	size of the dof.
   Added a cpp instruction to allow a build with pnetcdf but without netcdf to work on a single
	processor.   This reduces the number of expected failures from 13 to 12.

   Changed cpp formating in box_rearranger.F90.in to satisfy fussy cpp in intel compiler.

      There are a number of options to be exercised,
      and exercising these is not yet very convenient.
      The options can be set in the calls to

      box_rearrange_comp2io_{TYPE}
      box_rearrange_io2comp_{TYPE}

      as optional parameters. As the calls to these routine
      don't do this currently, you will need to add defines
      to the Makefile and/or modify the code in order
      to enable the different options.

      1) Out of the box, the original cam3_6_39 algorithms
      are used. 

      2) Compiling with

      -D_USE_ALLTOALLW

      (after deleting box_rearrange.o :-) )

      will use the MPI_ALLTOALLW branch that
      Ray put in originally. Note that this code is always
      compiled. The ifdef now simply sets the option
      variable and a runtime if-test selects calling
      MPI_ALLTOALLW .

      3) Compiling with

      -D_USE_COMP2IO_FC

      (and not compiling with -D_USE_ALLTOALLW and
      deleting box_rearrange.o)) will use the
      pio_swapm routine in box_rearrange_comp2io_{TYPE} .

      Similarly, compiling with

      -D_USE_COMP2IO_FC

      will use the pio_swapm routine in box_rearrange_io2comp_{TYPE} .

       a) The default for this is to use handshaking, use MPI_SEND (not MPI_ISEND),
       and set the throttle on the number of nonblocking requests to 64.

        b) If you want to try one of the other options, modify the defaults at the
	top of box_rearrange.F90 as follows:

	enabling/disabling handshaking (true/false)
	#define DEF_P2P_HANDSHAKE .true.

	enabling/disabling using MPI_ISEND  (true/false)
	#define DEF_P2P_ISEND .false.

	setting/disbling the throttle (>0, -1)
	#define DEF_P2P_MAXREQ 64

	and recompile.

        The initdecomp interface therefor has three additional optional parameters
	
	initDecomp_1dof_nf_box(Iosystem,basepioTYPE,dims,compDOF, IOdesc, start, count, method_in)

	where start and count are of type PIO_OFFSET and have the same number of dimensions as dims
	and method_in is an integer with value 1 (inner dim first) ,2 (outer dim first), or 3 (largest to smallest)
	If either start or count is provided both must be and method_in is ignored.

 Rename PIO_INITFILE to PIO_INIT and create a iosystem_desc_t structure which consists of the file independent portion of the file_desc_t structure remove iotype as an argument to this routine.
 Change the arguments to PIO_OPENFILE and PIO_CREATEFILE  from (File, filename) to (PIO, FIle, iotype, filename)
 Change the first argument to PIO_INITDECOMP from file_desc_t to iosystem_desc_t
 Explicitly include the io_desc_t  in calls to pio_read_darray and pio_write_darray

box rearranger restructured so that the creation of the scatter/gather
mpi types happens up front in the rearranger_create instead of at the
time of the rearrange.

also was able to remove some of the data in IODesc because it is no
longer needed after the type creation.

PIO in POP

	Several major changes were applied to PIO to enable use in 
POP.  This included the porting of the old version of the subroutine 
initDecomp_2dof_BIN.  The previous version of the subroutine does not 
use the two separate IODOF properly.

ChangeLog

	PIO now uses a changed log and new form of tags:  pio##_prod


Bugs fixed:
