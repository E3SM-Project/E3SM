	       - added perf_papi_enable to perf_inparm namelist to enable
	         PAPI counters 
               - added papi_inparm namelist and papi_ctr1,2,3,4 namelist
	         parameters to specify PAPI counters

	         event timing, added runtime selection of timing_disable,
	         perf_timer, timer_depth_limit, timing_detail_limit,

	       modified f_wrappers.c 
	       - replaced all t_xxx entry points with gptlxxx entry points,

	         output into a single file to perf_mod.F90
	       modified gptl.h 
	       - exposed gptlxxx entry points and to add support for choice 
	         of GPTL timer
	       modified gptl.inc
	       - removed t_xxx entry points and expose gptlxxx entry points
	       [Patrick Worley]

timing_061124: modified gptl.c 
	       - modified GPTLpr to add option to concatenate
	         all timing data in a single output file, added GPTL_enable
	         and GPTL_disable as runtime control of event timing, 
	         process 0-only reporting of timing options - unless DEBUG
	         cpp token defined
	       modified gptl.h 
	       - redefined GPTLpr parameters
	       modified f_wrappers.c
