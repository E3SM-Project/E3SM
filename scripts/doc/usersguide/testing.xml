<title>Testing overview</title>

<para>
CESM1.2 is accompanied by updated utilities that support automated testing of
the model.  In general, these should be used only after the model has
been ported to the target machine (see <xref linkend="port"/>).  The
tools
are <command>create_production_test</command> and $&create_test;.
</para>
<para>
The <command>create_production_test</command>
tool is executed from your $&CASEROOT;, and tests your case's ability to be restarted in a 
bit-for-bit fashion in a separate directory.  
</para>
<para>
New perl-based $&create_test; and $&query_tests; utilities are
executed from $&CCSMROOT;/scripts and allow you to quickly determine
what tests are available as well as set up and run one of numerous
supported tests or create any one of numerous test suites that are
used by the CESM developers for testing the model.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="create_production_test">
<title>Using <command>create_production_test</command></title>

<para> In general, after configuring and testing a case and before 
starting a long production job based on that case, it's important
to verify that the model restarts exactly.  This is a standard
requirement of the system and will help demonstrate stability
of the configuration technically.  The tool
create_production_test is located in the case directory,
and it sets up an ERT two month exact restart test in the same directory 
as the current case.  To use it, do the following
</para>

<screen>
> cd $CASEROOT
> ./create_production_test
> cd ../$CASE_ERT
> ./$CASE_ERT.test_build
> ./$CASE_ERT.submit

Check your test results. A successful test produces "PASS" as
the first word in the file, $CASE_ERT/TestStatus
</screen>

<para>If the test fails, see <xref linkend="failed_tests"/> for
test debugging guidance.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="query_tests">
<title>Using <command>query_tests</command></title> 

<para>
In CESM1.2, automated regression and system tests are now found in a
single xml-based file in
$&CCSMROOT&/scripts/ccsm_utils/Testlistxml/testlist.xml.  The new
utility &query_tests; allows you to quickly and easily query the
different CESM test categories that are supported as well as what
tests are available for different grids, compsets, machines and
compilers. You should use this command to become familiar with the
latest CESM testing capabilities before you utilize &create_test;.
You should first use the -h option in calling &query_tests; to
document its input options.  &query_tests; can be called with the
following arguments: 
</para>
<para><screen>
query_tests \
   -list <emphasis>name</emphasis>             
        name can be [compsets,grids,compilers,machines,categories,tests] \
   -compset <emphasis>name</emphasis>
       limit selection to target compset name \
   -category <emphasis>name</emphasis>             
       limit selection to target category name \
   -machine <emphasis>name</emphasis>             
       limit selection to target machine name \
   -compiler <emphasis>name</emphasis>             
       limit selection to target compiler name \
   -grid <emphasis>name</emphasis>             
       limit selection to target grid name match \
   -outputlist   
       outputs the found tests to the old-style text test lists. \ 
   -outputxml  
       outputs the found tests to an xml test list. 
</screen></para>
<para>
As an example to see all the tests that are supported for the compset B1850C5CN,
call $&query_tests; as follows
</para>
<para><screen>
./query_tests -compset B1850C5CN
</screen></para>

</para> 
<para>
To find all the tests configured to run on titan, using the PGI compiler, and using the 'prebeta' category, run:
</para>

<para>
If one wanted a new test list based on a particular query, one can use the -outputxml option to get the query output in XML format:
</para>
<screen>

</screen>
<para>
The above command will give one all of the 'aux_clm' tests in the file 'aux_clm.xml'.  Then, this test list can be used 
by create_test to run the aux_clm tests using the -xml_list option. 
</para>

<sect1 id="create_test">
<title>Using <command>create_test</command></title>

<para>
The new $&create_test; tool is located in the
<filename>$CCSMROOT/scripts/</filename> directory and can be used to
set up entire CESM test suites, as well as single standalone test cases. 
To see the list of test cases, and to view the available script options,
execute create_test -help or create_test without any arguments.
Creating a single test looks like:
</para>

<screen>
> cd $CCSMROOT/scripts
> ./create_test -testname ERS.f19_g16.X.yellowstone_intel -testid t01
> cd ERS.f19_g16.X.yellowstone_intel.t01
> ERS.f19_g16.X.yellowstone_intel.t01.test_build
./ERS.f19_g16.X.yellowstone_intel.t01.submit
Check your test results. A successful test produces "PASS" as
  the first word in the file TestStatus
</screen>

<para>
The above commands set up an exact restart test (ERS) at the 1.9x2.5_gx1v6
resolution using a dead model component set (X) for the machine yellowstone.
The testid provides a unique tag for the test in case it needs to
be rerun (i.e. using -testid t02).  
</para>

<para>
As an example, to create an entire suite of tests on yellowstone for
the 'prebeta' test category, do the following:
</para>

<screen>
> cd $CCSMROOT/scripts
> ./create_test \
     -xml_mach yellowstone \
     -xml_compiler intel \
     -xml_category prebeta \
     -testid alpha01a \
     -testroot /glade/scratch/$USER/alpha01a 
</screen>

<para> 
The above command will run all of the 'prebeta' tests in the
ccsm_utils/Testlistxml/testlist.xml file that are configured for the
category prebeta using the Intel compiler on yellowstone.  This is
almost identical to the development testing that CSEG carries out on
various machines.  In addition to creating the suite of tests in your
chosen test root, $&create_test; will also copy several helper scripts into
the testroot directory. The first will be named cs.status.$testid.$machine.
When run, this script will output the current status of all the tests.
The second will be named cs.submit.$testid.$machine.  This script is
automatically run when all the test cases are created, and it builds
and submits the suite of tests for you.

Some things to note about CESM tests:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>For usage information about the create_test tool, run "create_test -help".</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Test results are output in the TestStatus file.  The
TestStatus.out file provides additional details of the test run, which
may aid in debugging failed tests.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>At this time, tests are not always easily re-runnable from an
existing test directory.  Rather than rerun a previous test case, it's
recommended to set up a clean test case, (i.e. create one with a new
testid)
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Tests are built using the .test_build script.  This is different
from regular production cases which are built using the .build script.
Some tests require more than one executable, thus the .test_build
script builds all required executables upfront interactively.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The costs of tests vary widely.  Some are short and some are long.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If a test fails, see <xref linkend="failed_tests"/>for debugging assistance.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>There are -compare, -generate, and -baselineroot options for the
create_test tool that support regression testing. These tools allow
one to accomplish several goals: </para>
</listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para> -generate will save log files as well as coupler history
  NetCDF files in the baselineroot under the current case name. Later
  tests will compare their coupler history files against these
  baselines to check for numerical differences. </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
  <para> -compare will compare the current tag's tests against a
  previous tag's results, again for numerical accuracy.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem> 
  <para> -baselineroot simply specifies where you would like your
  baseline files to be stored. By default, the test system will choose
  the configured baseline root for your machine.</para>
  </listitem>
<listitem>
<para>There are extra test options that can be added to the test such
as _D, _E, or _P*.  These are described in more detail in the
create_test -help output.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
  <para> There is also a new option to create_test, -nlcompareonly.
  This allows one to create a suite of Smoke Build Namelist tests.
  These tests aren't compiled or run, the test cases are simply
  generated. These are useful in that you can create a suite for a
  previous CESM tag, then compare the current CESM tag's generated
  namelists against the previous tag.  This can potentially spot
  hard-to-find answer-changing errors, and/or unintended changes in
  development.

<title>Debugging Tests That Fail</title>

<para>
This section describes what steps can be taken to try to identify
why a test failed.  The primary information associated with reviewing
and debugging a run can be found in <xref linkend="troubleshooting_run_time"/>.
</para>

<para>
First, verify that a test case is no longer in the batch queue.  If
that's the case, then review the <link linkend="create_test">possible
test results</link> and compare that to the result in the TestStatus
file.  Next, review the TestStatus.out file to see if there is any
additional information about what the test did.  Finally, go to the
<link linkend="troubleshooting_run_time"> troubleshooting</link>
section and work through the various log files.
</para>

<para>
Finally, there are a couple other things to mention.  If the
TestStatus file contains "RUN" but the job is no longer in the queue,
it's likely that the job either timed out because it exceeded its
specified wall clock time, or the job hung or exited abnormally due to
some run-time error.  Check the batch log files to see if the job was
killed due to a time limit, and if it was, increase the time limit and
either resubmit the job, or generate a new test case and update the
time limit before submitting it.  </para>

<para>Also, a test case can fail
because either the job didn't run properly or because the test conditions
(i.e. exact restart) weren't met.  Try to determine whether the test failed
because the run failed, or because the test did not meet the test conditions.
If a test is failing early in a run, it's usually best to set up a
standalone case with the same configuration in order to debug problems.
If the test is running fine, but the test conditions are not being met
(i.e. exact restart), then that requires debugging of the model in the
context of the test conditions.
</para>

<para>
Not all tests will pass for all model configurations.  For more information, 
please check the known problems page for this release to find out which machines
have problems with which compsets and/or resolutions. 
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>All models are bit-for-bit reproducible on different processor
counts EXCEPT for POP2 and CICE diagnostics. The coupler is not
bit-for-bit reproducible out of the box. The BFBFLAG must be set to
TRUE in the &env_run.xml; file for the coupler to be bit-for-bit
reproducible. If you have a configuration where you expect bit-for-bit
reproducibility when you change the processor count AND you want to
validate this, then the BFBFLAG must be set to TRUE in the env_run.xml
file if the coupler is to meet this condition. The main purpose of the
BFBFLAG is to enforce a specific order of operations in the mapping
implementation. This constraint can impact mapping performance so it
is recommended that the BFBFLAG be set to FALSE in production. Also
note that the CESM system is fully bit-for-bit reproducible when
rerunning the same configuration on the same processor count. The
BFBFLAG is only required when trying to reproduce answers when
changing processor counts.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Some of the active components cannot run with the mpi serial
library.  This library takes the place of mpi calls when the model is
running on one processors and MPI is not available or not desirable.
The mpi serial library is invoked by setting the xml variable MPILIBS
to mpiserial in &env_build.xml;.  An effort is underway to extend the
mpi serial library to support all components' usage of the mpi library
with this standalone implementation. Also NOT all machines/platforms
are set up to enable setting MPILIBS to mpiserial.  See the summary of
<ulink url="../modelnl/machines.html">supported machines</ulink> for
details.  To use the mpi serial feature on your machine, you also need
to make changes in the config_compilers.xml  and config_machines.xml  files for that
machine. The best way to do this is to use a machine where MPILIBS can
be set to mpiserial and look at the type of
changes needed to make it work. Those same changes will need to be
introduced for your machine. For the Macros file this includes the
name of the compiler, possibly options to the compiler, and the
settings of the MPI library and include path. For the config_machines.xml
file you may want/need to modify the setting of MPICH_PATH. There also
maybe many settings of MPI specific environment variables that don't
matter when the mpiserial setting is used.</para>
