# This can be controlled by setting the MPE_PATH (or, equivalently, the 
# NETCDF environment variable), or MPE_<lang>_PATH CMake variables, where
# <lang> is the COMPONENT language one needs.
#
# Once done, this will define:
#
#   MPE_<lang>_FOUND        (BOOL) - system has MPE
#   MPE_<lang>_IS_SHARED    (BOOL) - whether library is shared/dynamic
#   MPE_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIR  (PATH) - Location of the C header file
#   MPE_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS (LIST) - the MPE include directories
#   MPE_<lang>_LIBRARY      (FILE) - Path to the C library file
#   MPE_<lang>_LIBRARIES    (LIST) - link these to use MPE
#
# The available COMPONENTS are: C Fortran
