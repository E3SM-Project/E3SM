The testmods in this folder contain different configuration
of output to request to eamxx. All the presets create a single
output file, all with a different name, which means one can
use 2+ presets at the same time.


Each preset does basically two things:
 1. create a yaml file in the case folder
 2. add the yaml file to the yaml_output_files xml setting of eamxx
