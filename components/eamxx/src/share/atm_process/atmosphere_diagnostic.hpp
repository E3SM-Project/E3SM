/*
 * A class representing an atmosphere diagnostic.
 * Diagnostics are similar to atmosphere processes in that
 * they take field(s) as input and produce some output.
 * 
 * This subclass definition makes a few distinctions that are
 * unique to diagnostics.
 * 
 * 1) Fields from the field manager can only be accessed as "Required".
 *    Meaning that an atmosphere diagnostic can not compute or update
 *    a field in the field manager.
 *    - note, if you want to update something in the field manager it
 *            should happen in an atmosphere process.
 * 2) Diagnostics produce a single field output.
 *    Typically the field output will be to buffered memory, meaning it
 *    could be overwritten later in the simulation.
 *    A diagnostic output is meant to be used for OUTPUT or a PROPERTY CHECK.

//          You could, but there's no need. You can simply register the common one right below, using your
//          atmosphere diagnostic subclass name as templated argument. If you roll your own creator function, you
//          *MUST* ensure that it correctly sets up the self pointer after creating the shared_ptr.
//          This is *necessary* until we can safely switch to std::enable_shared_from_this.
//          For more details, see the comments at the top of ekat_std_enable_shared_from_this.hpp.
