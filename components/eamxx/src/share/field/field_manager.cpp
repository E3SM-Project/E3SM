  // This method is responsible of allocating the fields in the repo. The most delicate part is
  // the allocation of fields group, in the case where bundling is requested. In particular,
  // we want to try to honor as many requests for bundling as possible. If we can't accommodate
  // all the GroupRequest's that have bundling either Required or Preferred, we will try again
  // by considering only those with Required bundling (see GroupRequest for detail on those
  // values). If we are still not able to honor requests, we will error out. An example of a
  // scenario where we can't honor all requests is given by the three groups G1=(A,B), G2=(B,C),
  // and G3=(A,C). Clearly, only two of these groups can have contiguous allocation.

  // To understand how we can parse the groups to figure out if/how to accommodate all requests,
  // consider the following GR:  G1=(A,B,C), G2=(A,B,C,D,E), G3=(C,D), G4=(C,D,E,F), G5=((D,E,F,G).
  // The ordering of fields (A,B,C,D,E,F,G) clearly accommodates all GRs, though it might not
  // be obvious if one scrambled the fields within each GR.

  // This is the sequence of operations that allows us to establish if (and how) we can honor
  // all the requests:
  //  1) ensure all groups contain the desired members. This means that we need to
  //     loop over GroupRequest (GR), and make sure there are fields registered in those
  //     groups (querying m_field_groups info structs). If a GR is derived from another
  //     GR, like a 'Subset' group (see GR header for details), we make sure the group
  //     is in m_field_groups (if not, add it), and contains all the proper fields.
  //  2) Focus only on GR that require (or prefer) a bundled group, discarding others.
  //     All the remaining group can simply "grab" individual fields later (and they
  //     can even grab some "individual" fields, and some fields that are slices of
  //     another group).
  //  3) Divide the groups found at step 2 into 'clusters'. A cluster is a collection
  //     of field groups such that each group in it share at least one field with
  //     at least another group in the cluster. If two groups are not in the same
  //     cluster, they cannot share any field. Each cluster of field groups can be
  //     processed individually, since allocations are completely independent.
  //     This allows to reduce the combination of groups to checks later.
  //     Note: to build a cluster, take any group not yet in a cluster. Then iteratively
  //     add any group that intersects the cluster, until no intersections are found.
  //  4) If there is no group in the cluster that contains all the fields of the cluster,
  //     create the cluster group C. In order to accommodate all requests for bundled groups,
  //     we must be able to allocate C bundled.
  //  5) For each cluster, call the function contiguous_superset from scream_utils.hpp
  //     (see that file for details). If the fcn fails to find an ordering of the cluster's
  //     field that accommodate all bundled requests, it will return an empty list.
  //     Otherwise it will return the ordering of all fields in the cluster that allows all
  //     groups of the cluster to be a contiguous subset of C.
  //  6) If step 4 fails for a cluster, remove from the cluster the groups whose bundling
  //     is only "Preferred", and re-try.
  //     Notes:
  //      - eliminating 1+ groups from the cluster may actually "disconnect" the cluster,
  //        into 2+ separate clusters, which can be treated separately. For simplicity,
  //        we won't re build the cluster. It might make calling the function
  //        contiguous_superset a bit more expensive, but it won't alter the existence
  //        of a contiguous ordering.
  //      - it is possible that, say, removing G1 still doesn't yield a "bundle-able"
  //        cluster, but removing G2 does. In general, we should try to remove groups
  //        one at a time, then two at a time, then three at a time,... until we
  //        reach a point where the remaining groups can all be bundled. This is overly
  //        complicated, so if 4 fails, we simply start removing groups with "Preferred"
  //        bundling until 4 succeeds or we run out of groups with bundling=Preferred
  //        to remove.
  //

  // Start by processing group request. This function will ensure that, if there's a
