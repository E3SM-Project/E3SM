# Cloud fraction does not yet have a set of unit tests or a BFB test comparing with the F90
# code.
# The cloud fraction stand alone test, in the /tests/ directory covers a range of property
# tests.
# The BFB test will require some amount of work, as the specific ice cloud fraction scheme
# here is just an option in a more involved F90 subroutine.  Furture work would be to
# include a BFB test with the F90 code, located in /components/eam/src/physics/cam/cldfrc2m.F90
