# MAM4 Integration Code

This folder contains C++ implementations of the higher-level MAM4 interface
routines for aerosol microphysics, cloud-aerosol interactions, and optical
properties. We've retained the overall structure of the original Fortran code
to make it easier to understand for folks who are more familiar with the
original implementation of MAM4.
