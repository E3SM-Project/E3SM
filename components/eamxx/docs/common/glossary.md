#### Model
#### Atmosphere Model
#### Performance Portability
Coding strategy that allows a user to run the same model on differing architectures (cpu, gpu, ...) without modifying the source code and, ideally, without sacrificing performance.
#### Atmospheric Process
==Placeholder text==
At minimum, every process must contain 3 functions defining the core parts of a process with the names:

- `initialize_impl()`
- `run_impl()`
- `finalize_impl()`
#### Baseline Test
#### Bit-for-Bit (BFB)
#### Verification and Validation (V&V)
