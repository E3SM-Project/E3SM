# EAMxx User Guide

This section contains documentation on how to create, setup, and run CIME cases
with EAMxx as the atmosphere component.
It is assumed that the reader has a familiarity with the
[CIME Case Control System](https://esmci.github.io/cime/versions/master/html/users_guide/index.html).
In particular, we assume
that the user knows how to create a case, and what the `case.setup`,
`case.build`, and `case.submit` commands do.

This user guide is still under construction.
In the meantime, in case you do not find the information you need,
we suggest visiting our public
[EAMxx user guide](https://acme-climate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/3858890786/EAMxx+User+s+Guide)
on Confluence.
