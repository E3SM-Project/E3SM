# Diagnostic parsing precedence

EAMxx resolves diagnostic field names through a series of pattern tests applied
in a fixed priority order.  Understanding this order lets you predict — and
control — how composite names are parsed.

## Priority order (highest to lowest)

1. **Built-in aliases** — recognized shorthands expand before anything else.
   E.g., `X_atm_backtend` → `X_minus_X_prev_over_dt`.
   See [Built-in aliases](builtin_aliases.md).

2. **`_over_dt` suffix** — checked before binary ops to prevent `X_over_dt`
   from being misinterpreted as `BinaryOpsDiag(X, over, dt)`.

3. **Specific named patterns** — `_at_<level>`, `_at_<pressure>`, `_at_<height>`,
   `_horiz_avg`, `_vert_avg`, `_vert_sum`, `_zonal_avg`, `_pvert_derivative`,
   `_zvert_derivative`, `_where_..._op_val` (conditional sampling), etc.

4. **Binary ops** — `A_(plus|minus|times|over)_B`.
   The first capture group is *greedy*, so the left operand extends as far as
   possible: `A_minus_B_over_C` parses as `(A_minus_B) over C`, i.e., `(A−B)/C`.
   Binary ops are checked **before** `_prev` so that `X_minus_X_prev` correctly
   resolves as `BinaryOpsDiag(X, minus, X_prev)` rather than
   `FieldPrevDiag(X_minus_X)`.

5. **`_prev` suffix** — checked after binary ops so that the right-hand operand
   of a binary op can itself be a `_prev` field.

6. **Histograms** — `X_histogram_<bin_config>`.

7. **Plain field or diagnostic name** — the string is looked up directly in the
   atmosphere-diagnostic factory.

## Key rules

### Rule 1: greedy left operand for binary ops

The binary-ops regex is:

```none
([A-Za-z0-9_.+\-\*\÷]+)_(plus|minus|times|over)_([A-Za-z0-9_.+\-\*\÷]+)$
```

The first group is greedy.  For a string with multiple operator tokens, the
**rightmost** operator becomes the outermost (lowest-precedence) operation:

```none
A_minus_B_over_C  →  (A_minus_B) over C  →  (A − B) / C
```

### Rule 2: `_prev` is resolved after binary ops

`binary_ops` is tested before `field_prev`, so `X_minus_X_prev` parses
as `BinaryOpsDiag(X, minus, X_prev)`.  Then `X_prev` recurses and is
resolved as `FieldPrevDiag(X)`.  A bare `X_prev` (no operator keyword)
still resolves as `FieldPrevDiag(X)` because `binary_ops` does not match
(there is no operator keyword in the string).

## Worked example: the `bt` family

```yaml
fields:
  physics_pg2:
    aliases:
      # bt1 is an intermediate — needed by bt2 and bt_prod but not written to NC
      - bt1:=f_minus_f_prev_over_dt
      # Parsing:
      #   _over_dt suffix matched first → FieldOverDtDiag( f_minus_f_prev )
      #   f_minus_f_prev → BinaryOpsDiag( f, minus, f_prev )
      #   f_prev → FieldPrevDiag( f )
      # Result: (f(t1) − f(t0)) / (t1 − t0)

      # bt2 = tendency of the tendency (also intermediate)
      - bt2:=bt1_minus_bt1_prev
      # Only one "minus" token → BinaryOpsDiag( bt1, minus, bt1_prev )
      # bt1_prev → FieldPrevDiag( bt1 )

    field_names:
      # bt_prod = product of the two tendencies — IS written to NC
      - bt_prod:=bt1_times_bt2

      # bt_osc_count = indicator that bt_prod is negative (tendency oscillating)
      - bt_osc_count:=count_where_bt_prod_lt_0
      # ConditionalSampling: input=count, condition_field=bt_prod, op=lt, value=0
```

The `aliases` section names intermediate sub-expressions that are needed
as inputs to other diagnostics but should not appear in the output file.
The `field_names` section lists what actually gets written to NetCDF.
Use `:=` in both sections to give a convenient name to a complex expression.

## Avoiding ambiguity

Use `:=` aliases to break complex expressions into named sub-expressions.
This is always clearer than relying on implicit precedence.

## Future proposal: `__` grouping marker

We propose `__` (double-underscore) as an explicit precedence grouper in a
future parser version.  Example:

```none
f_minus__f_prev_over_dt__
```

would parse as `f − (f_prev / dt)` rather than `(f − f_prev) / dt`.
This is not yet implemented; use named aliases today.
