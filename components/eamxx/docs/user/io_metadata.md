# IO Metadata

The IO metadata used for EAMxx output variables is stored in a csv file along the source code.
Please find the csv file [here](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM/blob/master/components/eamxx/src/share/util/io_metadata).
If you would like to contribute to expanding the metadata, please edit this csv file and issue a PR.
Thank you!
