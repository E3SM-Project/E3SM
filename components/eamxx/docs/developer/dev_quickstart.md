# Quick-start Guide for Developers

- Mention full-model, but don't go into detail
- Focus on standalone build (test all scream)
  - maybe high-level description, then link to it
  - why you should use it
  - presets for important configurations
    - dbg, dbg-single, etc.
  - also possible to roll your own cmake build and focus narrowly on what you're doing
  - reach out if you believe you're running into a bug within `test-all-scream`
  - mention baselines/-comparisons
