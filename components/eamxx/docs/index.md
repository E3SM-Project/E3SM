# The C++ E3SM Atmosphere Model (EAMxx)

Some nice introductory text goes here! Maybe some figures, too. Who knows?!

* The [User Guide](user/index.md) explains how to run EAMxx, both in
  its standalone configuration and within E3SM.
* The [Developer Guide](developer/index.md) contains all the information needed
  to contribute to the development of EAMxx.
* The [Technical Guide](technical/index.md) contains all the technical
  information about EAMxx.
