abstract = {Over the past decade a new type of global climate model (GCM) has emerged, which is known as a multiscale modeling framework (MMF). Colorado State University's MMF represents a coupling between the Community Atmosphere Model and the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) to serve as the cloud-resolving model (CRM) that replaces traditionally parameterized convection in GCMs. However, due to the high computational expense of the MMF, the grid size of the embedded CRM is typically limited to 4 km for long-term climate simulations. With grid sizes this coarse, shallow convective processes and turbulence cannot be resolved and must still be parameterized within the context of the embedded CRM. This paper describes a computationally efficient closure that aims to better represent turbulence and shallow convective processes in coarse-grid CRMs. The closure is based on the assumed probability density function (PDF) technique to serve as the subgrid-scale (SGS) condensation scheme and turbulence closure that employs a diagnostic method to determine the needed input moments. This paper describes the scheme, as well as the formulation of the eddy length which is empirically determined from large eddy simulation (LES) data. CRM tests utilizing the closure yields good results when compared to LESs for two trade-wind cumulus cases, a transition from stratocumulus to cumulus, and continental cumulus. This new closure improves the representation of clouds through the use of SGS condensation scheme and turbulence due to better representation of the buoyancy flux and dissipation rates. In addition, the scheme reduces the sensitivity of CRM simulations to horizontal grid spacing. The improvement when compared to the standard low-order closure configuration of the SAM is especially striking.},

    abstract = { Abstract The land surface parameterization used with the community climate model (CCM3) and the climate system model (CSM1), the National Center for Atmospheric Research land surface model (NCAR LSM1), has been modified as part of the development of the next version of these climate models. This new model is known as the community land model (CLM2). In CLM2, the surface is represented by five primary subgrid land cover types (glacier, lake, wetland, urban, vegetated) in each grid cell. The vegetated portion of a grid cell is further divided into patches of up to 4 of 16 plant functional types, each with its own leaf and stem area index and canopy height. The relative area of each subgrid unit, the plant functional type, and leaf area index are obtained from 1-km satellite data. The soil texture dataset allows vertical profiles of sand and clay. Most of the physical parameterizations in the model were also updated. Major model differences include: 10 layers for soil temperature and soil water with explicit treatment of liquid water and ice; a multilayer snowpack; runoff based on the TOPMODEL concept; new formulation of ground and vegetation fluxes; and vertical root profiles from a global synthesis of ecological studies. Simulations with CCM3 show significant improvements in surface air temperature, snow cover, and runoff for CLM2 compared to LSM1. CLM2 generally warms surface air temperature in all seasons compared to LSM1, reducing or eliminating many cold biases. Annual precipitation over land is reduced from 2.35 mm dayâˆ’1 in LSM1 to 2.14 mm dayâˆ’1 in CLM2. The hydrologic cycle is also different. Transpiration and ground evaporation are reduced. Leaves and stems evaporate more intercepted water annually in CLM2 than LSM1. Global runoff from land increases from 0.75 mm dayâˆ’1 in LSM1 to 0.84 mm dayâˆ’1 in CLM2. The annual cycle of runoff is greatly improved in CLM2, especially in arctic and boreal regions where the model has low runoff in cold seasons when the soil is frozen and high runoff during the snowmelt season. Most of the differences between CLM2 and LSM1 are attributed to particular parameterizations rather than to different surface datasets. Important processes include: multilayer snow, frozen water, interception, soil water limitation to latent heat, and higher aerodynamic resistances to heat exchange from ground. }

abstract = {Abstract Marine low-level clouds continue to be poorly simulated in models despite many studies and field experiments devoted to their improvement. Here we focus on the spatial errors in the cloud decks in the Department of Energy Earth system model (E3SM) relative to the satellite climatology by calculating centroid distances, area ratios, and overlap ratios. Since model dynamics is better simulated than clouds, these errors are attributed primarily to the model physics. To gain additional insight, we performed a sensitivity run in which model winds were nudged to those of reanalysis. This results in a large change (but not necessarily an improvement) in the simulated cloud decks. These differences between simulations are mainly due to the interactions between model dynamics and physics. These results suggest that both model physics (widely recognized) and its interaction with dynamics (less recognized) are important to model improvement in simulating these low-level clouds.}

    abstract = { AbstractThis study clarifies the causes of intermodel differences in the global-average temperature response to doubled CO2, commonly known as equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). The authors begin by noting several issues with the standard approach for decomposing ECS into a sum of forcing and feedback terms. This leads to a derivation of an alternative method based on linearizing the effect of the net feedback. Consistent with previous studies, the new method identifies shortwave cloud feedback as the dominant source of intermodel spread in ECS. This new approach also reveals that covariances between cloud feedback and forcing, between lapse rate and longwave cloud feedbacks, and between albedo and shortwave cloud feedbacks play an important and previously underappreciated role in determining model differences in ECS. Defining feedbacks based on fixed relative rather than specific humidity (as suggested by Held and Shell) reduces the covariances between processes and leads to more straightforward interpretations of results. }

abstract = {Abstract This study provides an overview of the coupled high-resolution version 1 of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1) and documents the characteristics of a 50 year long high-resolution control simulation with time-invariant 1950 forcings following the HighResMIP protocol. In terms of global root-mean-squared error metrics, this high-resolution simulation is generally superior to results from the low-resolution configuration of E3SMv1 (due to resolution, tuning changes, and possibly initialization procedure) and compares favorably to models in the CMIP5 ensemble. Ocean and sea ice simulation is particularly improved, due to better resolution of bathymetry, the ability to capture more variability and extremes in winds and currents, and the ability to resolve mesoscale ocean eddies. The largest improvement in this regard is an ice-free Labrador Sea, which is a major problem at low resolution. Interestingly, several features found to improve with resolution in previous studies are insensitive to resolution or even degrade in E3SMv1. Most notable in this regard are warm bias and associated stratocumulus deficiency in eastern subtropical oceans and lack of improvement in El Nino. Another major finding of this study is that resolution increase had negligible impact on climate sensitivity (measured by net feedback determined through uniform +4K prescribed sea surface temperature increase) and aerosol sensitivity. Cloud response to resolution increase consisted of very minor decrease at all levels. Large-scale patterns of precipitation bias were also relatively unaffected by grid spacing.}

    abstract = { Abstract Any comprehensive numerical model is composed of two parts: a dynamical kernel solving for the fluid mechanical field equations and a physical package to parameterize the ensemble effect of subgrid-scale processes upon the resolved scales of the model. There are a number of techniques that can be used for combining the dynamics and physics contributions. One such method called â€œsplittingâ€ is used in some models because of its simplicity and stability property. In this article the authors demonstrate that the splitting method may introduce serious truncation errors when used in conjunction with long time steps that are permitted by semi-implicit and semi-Lagrangian marching algorithms. }

    abstract = { The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) version 5 includes a spectral element dynamical core option from NCARâ€™s High-Order Method Modeling Environment. It is a continuous Galerkin spectral finite-element method designed for fully unstructured quadrilateral meshes. The current configurations in CAM are based on the cubed-sphere grid. The main motivation for including a spectral element dynamical core is to improve the scalability of CAM by allowing quasi-uniform grids for the sphere that do not require polar filters. In addition, the approach provides other state-of-the-art capabilities such as improved conservation properties. Spectral elements are used for the horizontal discretization, while most other aspects of the dynamical core are a hybrid of well-tested techniques from CAMâ€™s finite volume and global spectral dynamical core options. Here we first give an overview of the spectral element dynamical core as used in CAM. We then give scalability and performance results from CAM running with three different dynamical core options within the Community Earth System Model, using a pre-industrial time-slice configuration. We focus on high-resolution simulations, using 1/4 degree, 1/8 degree, and T341 spectral truncation horizontal grids. }

abstract = {Abstract Because weather and climate models must capture a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales, they rely heavily on parameterizations of subgrid-scale processes. The goal of this study is to demonstrate that the assumptions used to couple these parameterizations have an important effect on the climate of version 0 of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) General Circulation Model (GCM), a close relative of version 1 of the Community Earth System Model (CESM1). Like most GCMs, parameterizations in E3SM are sequentially split in the sense that parameterizations are called one after another with each subsequent process feeling the effect of the preceding processes. This coupling strategy is noncommutative in the sense that the order in which processes are called impacts the solution. By examining a suite of 24 simulations with deep convection, shallow convection, macrophysics/microphysics, and radiation parameterizations reordered, process order is shown to have a big impact on predicted climate. In particular, reordering of processes induces differences in net climate feedback that are as big as the intermodel spread in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. One reason why process ordering has such a large impact is that the effect of each process is influenced by the processes preceding it. Where output is written is therefore an important control on apparent model behavior. Application of k-means clustering demonstrates that the positioning of macro/microphysics and shallow convection plays a critical role on the model solution.},

    abstract = { AbstractThe Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) has developed a coupled general circulation model (CM3) for the atmosphere, oceans, land, and sea ice. The goal of CM3 is to address emerging issues in climate change, including aerosolâ€“cloud interactions, chemistryâ€“climate interactions, and coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere. The model is also designed to serve as the physical system component of earth system models and models for decadal prediction in the near-term futureâ€”for example, through improved simulations in tropical land precipitation relative to earlier-generation GFDL models. This paper describes the dynamical core, physical parameterizations, and basic simulation characteristics of the atmospheric component (AM3) of this model. Relative to GFDL AM2, AM3 includes new treatments of deep and shallow cumulus convection, cloud droplet activation by aerosols, subgrid variability of stratiform vertical velocities for droplet activation, and atmospheric chemistry driven by emissions with advective, convective, and turbulent transport. AM3 employs a cubed-sphere implementation of a finite-volume dynamical core and is coupled to LM3, a new land model with ecosystem dynamics and hydrology. Its horizontal resolution is approximately 200 km, and its vertical resolution ranges approximately from 70 m near the earthâ€™s surface to 1 to 1.5 km near the tropopause and 3 to 4 km in much of the stratosphere. Most basic circulation features in AM3 are simulated as realistically, or more so, as in AM2. In particular, dry biases have been reduced over South America. In coupled mode, the simulation of Arctic sea ice concentration has improved. AM3 aerosol optical depths, scattering properties, and surface clear-sky downward shortwave radiation are more realistic than in AM2. The simulation of marine stratocumulus decks remains problematic, as in AM2. The most intense 0.2\% of precipitation rates occur less frequently in AM3 than observed. The last two decades of the twentieth century warm in CM3 by 0.32Â°C relative to 1881â€“1920. The Climate Research Unit (CRU) and Goddard Institute for Space Studies analyses of observations show warming of 0.56Â° and 0.52Â°C, respectively, over this period. CM3 includes anthropogenic cooling by aerosolâ€“cloud interactions, and its warming by the late twentieth century is somewhat less realistic than in CM2.1, which warmed 0.66Â°C but did not include aerosolâ€“cloud interactions. The improved simulation of the direct aerosol effect (apparent in surface clear-sky downward radiation) in CM3 evidently acts in concert with its simulation of cloudâ€“aerosol interactions to limit greenhouse gas warming. }

    abstract = { Abstract Various numerical issues concerning different approaches to the time stepping of physical parameterizations in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models are examined. Parallel-split and sequential-split methods are explained and analyzed in the context of simple model equations. Terms arising from the use of splitting techniques produce erroneous solutions if the time step is large (of the size typically used in semi-implicit semi-Lagrangian models). Errors in steady-state solutions are examined in particular, as these may lead to systematic biases and climate drift. Splitting methods are then applied to a multiple timescale problem. For large time steps, a useful scheme should produce an accurate discrete representation of the reduced system, which has fast modes removed. Parallel splitting may be of limited use because only explicit versions model reduced systems without splitting errors, but such versions cannot stably integrate fast modes with acceptably large time steps. In a numerical context, sequential-splitting schemes are more flexible. Second-order schemes can be more accurate than first-order ones if the time step is very large, provided careful data initialization is performed to prevent noisy solutions for stiff problems. }

    abstract = { Abstract Split schemes for time-stepping physical parameterizations in numerical weather prediction and climate models are investigated within the context of simplified model equations. A symmetrized-splitting technique is applied to various parameterized systems containing fast and slow physics processes. The physics processes are represented by time-dependent forcing terms and linear damping/oscillatory terms. Finite-difference schemes, obtained from the splitting procedures, are examined to determine their stability properties, degree of splitting error, and truncation error. This analysis provides insight into the advantages and disadvantages of different splitting procedures across a range of possible parameterization scenarios. Many schemes obtained via splitting have time-step-dependent splitting errors, which can lead to inaccurate solutions when fast processes are present and the time step is large. Some splitting combinations, however, are more useful than others. The symmetrized-splitting procedure considered in this paper can produce stable first- and second-order accurate schemes, which have either no significant splitting errors or acceptably small errors relative to a steady-state solution. The consequences of this analysis for physics coupling strategies in realistic numerical weather prediction and climate models are noted. }

In addition, the range of climate variables and processes that have been evaluated has greatly expanded, and differences between models and observations are increasingly quantified using ?performance metrics?. In this chapter, model evaluation covers simulation of the mean climate, of historical climate change, of variability on multiple time scales and of regional modes of variability. This evaluation is based on recent internationally coordinated model experiments, including simulations of historic and paleo climate, specialized experiments designed to provide insight into key climate processes and feedbacks and regional climate downscaling. Figure 9.44 provides an overview of model capabilities as assessed in this chapter, including improvements, or lack thereof, relative to models assessed in the AR4. The chapter concludes with an assessment of recent work connecting model performance to the detection and attribution of climate change as well as to future projections.}

These studies employ observations but still require an element of modeling to infer ECS. Their diagnosed effective ECS over the historical period of around 2 K holds up to scrutiny, but there is tentative evidence that this underestimates the true ECS from a doubling of carbon dioxide. Different choices of energy imbalance data explain most of the difference between published best estimates, and effective radiative forcing dominates the overall uncertainty. For decadal analyses the largest source of uncertainty comes from a poor understanding of the relationship between ECS and decadal feedback. Considerable progress could be made by diagnosing effective radiative forcing in models. }

The scheme produces reasonable representations of cloud particle size and number concentration when compared to observations, and it represents expected and observed spatial variations in cloud microphysical quantities. The scheme has smaller particles and higher number concentrations over land than the standard bulk microphysics in the GCM and is able to balance the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget with 60\% the liquid water of the standard scheme, in better agreement with retrieved values. The new scheme diagnostically treats both the mixing ratio and number concentration of rain and snow, and it is therefore able to differentiate the two key regimes, consisting of drizzle in shallow, warm clouds and larger rain drops in deeper cloud systems. The modeled rain and snow size distributions are consistent with observations. }

    abstract = { AbstractPrognostic precipitation is added to a cloud microphysical scheme for global climate models. Results indicate very similar performance to other commonly used mesoscale schemes in an offline driver for idealized warm rain cases, better than the previous version of the global model microphysics scheme with diagnostic precipitation. In the mixed phase regime, there is significantly more water and less ice, which may address a common bias seen with the scheme in climate simulations in the Arctic. For steady forcing cases, the scheme has limited sensitivity to time step out to the ~15-min time steps typical of global models. The scheme is similar to other schemes with moderate sensitivity to vertical resolution. The limited time step sensitivity bodes well for use of the scheme in multiscale models from the mesoscale to the large scale. The scheme is sensitive to idealized perturbations of cloud drop and crystal number. Precipitation decreases and condensate increases with increasing drop number, indicating substantial decreases in precipitation efficiency. The sensitivity is less than with the previous version of the scheme for low drop number concentrations (Nc < 100 cmâˆ’3). Ice condensate increases with ice number, with large decreases in liquid condensate as well for a mixed phase case. As expected with prognostic precipitation, accretion is stronger than with diagnostic precipitation and the accretion to autoconversion ratio increases faster with liquid water path (LWP), in better agreement with idealized models and earlier studies than the previous version. }

The coupling between the microphysics and the rest of the model is modified to make it more flexible. Single-column tests show the new microphysics can simulate a constrained drizzling stratocumulus case. Substepping the cloud condensation (macrophysics) within a time step improves single-column results. Simulations of mixed-phase cases are strongly sensitive to ice nucleation. The new microphysics alters process rates in both single-column and global simulations, even at low (200 km) horizontal resolution. Thus, prognostic precipitation can be important, even in low-resolution simulations where advection of precipitation is not important. Accretion dominates as liquid water path increases in agreement with cloud-resolving model simulations and estimates from observations. The new microphysics with prognostic precipitation increases the ratio of accretion over autoconversion. The change in process rates appears to significantly reduce aerosolâ€“cloud interactions and indirect radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols by up to 33\% (depending on substepping) to below 1 W mâˆ’2 of cooling between simulations with preindustrial (1850) and present-day (2000) aerosol emissions. }

    abstract = { Abstract A new cloudy boundary layer single-column model is presented. It is designed to be flexible enough to represent a variety of cloudiness regimesâ€”such as cumulus, stratocumulus, and clear regimesâ€”without the need for case-specific adjustments. The methodology behind the model is the so-called assumed probability density function (PDF) method. The parameterization differs from higher-order closure or mass-flux schemes in that it achieves closure by the use of a relatively sophisticated joint PDF of vertical velocity, temperature, and moisture. A family of PDFs is chosen that is flexible enough to represent various cloudiness regimes. A double Gaussian family proposed by previous works is used. Predictive equations for grid box means and a number of higher-order turbulent moments are advanced in time. These moments are in turn used to select a particular member from the family of PDFs, for each time step and grid box. Once a PDF member has been selected, the scheme integrates over the PDF to close higher-order moments, buoyancy terms, and diagnose cloud fraction and liquid water. Since all the diagnosed moments for a given grid box and time step are derived from the same unique joint PDF, they are guaranteed to be consistent with one another. A companion paper presents simulations produced by the single-column model. }

abstract = {Abstract This work documents the first version of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) new Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). We focus on the standard resolution of the fully-coupled physical model designed to address DOE mission-relevant water cycle questions. Its components include atmosphere and land (110km grid spacing), ocean and sea ice (60km in the mid-latitudes and 30km at the equator and poles), and river transport (55km) models. This base configuration will also serve as a foundation for additional configurations exploring higher horizontal resolution as well as augmented capabilities in the form of biogeochemistry and cryosphere configurations. The performance of E3SMv1 is evaluated by means of a standard set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima (CMIP6 DECK) simulations consisting of a long pre-industrial control, historical simulations (ensembles of fully coupled and prescribed SSTs) as well as idealized CO2 forcing simulations. The model performs well overall with biases typical of other CMIP-class models, although the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is weaker than many CMIP-class models. While the E3SMv1 historical ensemble captures the bulk of the observed warming between pre-industrial (1850) and present-day, the trajectory of the warming diverges from observations in the second half of the 20th century with a period of delayed warming followed by an excessive warming trend. Using a two-layer energy balance model, we attribute this divergence to the model's strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFari+aci = -1.65 W m-2) and high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS = 5.3 K).},

    abstract = { AbstractA unified turbulence and cloud parameterization based on multivariate probability density functions (PDFs) has been incorporated into the GFDL atmospheric general circulation model (AM3). This PDF-based parameterization not only predicts subgrid variations in vertical velocity, temperature, and total water, which bridge subgrid-scale processes (e.g., aerosol activation and cloud microphysics) and grid-scale dynamic and thermodynamic fields, but also unifies the treatment of planetary boundary layer (PBL), shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics. This parameterization is called the Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CLUBB) parameterization. With the incorporation of CLUBB in AM3, coupled with a two-moment cloud microphysical scheme, AM3â€“CLUBB allows for a more physically based and self-consistent treatment of aerosol activation, cloud micro- and macrophysics, PBL, and shallow convection.The configuration and performance of AM3â€“CLUBB are described. Cloud and radiation fields, as well as most basic climate features, are modeled realistically. Relative to AM3, AM3â€“CLUBB improves the simulation of coastal stratocumulus, a longstanding deficiency in GFDL models, and their seasonal cycle, especially at higher horizontal resolution, but global skill scores deteriorate slightly. Through sensitivity experiments, it is shown that 1) the two-moment cloud microphysics helps relieve the deficiency of coastal stratocumulus, 2) using the CLUBB subgrid cloud water variability in the cloud microphysics has a considerable positive impact on global cloudiness, and 3) the impact of adjusting CLUBB parameters is to improve the overall agreement between model and observations. }

    abstract = { AbstractAtmospheric modeling with element-based high-order Galerkin methods presents a unique challenge to the conventional physics–dynamics coupling paradigm, due to the highly irregular distribution of nodes within an element and the distinct numerical characteristics of the Galerkin method. The conventional coupling procedure is to evaluate the physical parameterizations (physics) on the dynamical core grid. Evaluating the physics at the nodal points exacerbates numerical noise from the Galerkin method, enabling and amplifying local extrema at element boundaries. Grid imprinting may be substantially reduced through the introduction of an entirely separate, approximately isotropic finite-volume grid for evaluating the physics forcing. Integration of the spectral basis over the control volumes provides an area-average state to the physics, which is more representative of the state in the vicinity of the nodal points rather than the nodal point itself and is more consistent with the notion of a “large-scale state” required by conventional physics packages. This study documents the implementation of a quasi-equal-area physics grid into NCAR’s Community Atmosphere Model Spectral Element and is shown to be effective at mitigating grid imprinting in the solution. The physics grid is also appropriate for coupling to other components within the Community Earth System Model, since the coupler requires component fluxes to be defined on a finite-volume grid, and one can be certain that the fluxes on the physics grid are, indeed, volume averaged. }

    abstract = { Abstract A prognostic equation for ice crystal number concentration together with an ice nucleation scheme are implemented in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmospheric Model version 3 (CAM3) with the aim of studying the indirect effect of aerosols on cold clouds. The effective radius of ice crystals, which is used in the radiation and gravitational settlement calculations, is now calculated from model-predicted mass and number of ice crystals rather than diagnosed as a function of temperature. A water vapor deposition scheme is added to replace the condensation and evaporation (Câ€“E) in the standard CAM3 for ice clouds. The repartitioning of total water into liquid and ice in mixed-phase clouds as a function of temperature is removed, and ice supersaturation is allowed. The predicted ice water content in the modified CAM3 is in better agreement with the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) data than that in the standard CAM3. The cirrus cloud fraction near the tropical tropopause, which is underestimated in the standard CAM3 as revealed through comparison with the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) data, is increased by 20\%â€“30\%, and the cold temperature bias there is reduced by 1â€“2 K. However, an increase in the cloud fraction in polar regions makes the underestimation (by âˆ¼20 W mâˆ’2) of downwelling shortwave radiation in the standard CAM3 even worse. A sensitivity test reducing the threshold relative humidity with respect to ice (RHi) for heterogeneous ice nucleation from 120\% to 105\% (representing nearly perfect ice nuclei) increases the global cloud cover by 1.4\%, temperature near the tropical tropopause by 4â€“5 K, and water vapor in the stratosphere by 50\%â€“80\%. }

Prognostic variables include cloud droplet and cloud ice mass mixing ratios and number concentrations. The scheme treats several microphysical processes, including hydrometeor collection, condensation/evaporation, freezing, melting, and sedimentation. The activation of droplets on aerosol is physically based and coupled to a subgrid vertical velocity. Unique aspects of the scheme, relative to existing two-moment schemes developed for general circulation models, are the diagnostic treatment of rain and snow number concentration and mixing ratio and the explicit treatment of subgrid cloud water variability for calculation of the microphysical process rates. Numerical aspects of the scheme are described in detail using idealized one-dimensional offline tests of the microphysics. Sensitivity of the scheme to time step, vertical resolution, and numerical method for diagnostic precipitation is investigated over a range of conditions. It is found that, in general, two substeps are required for numerical stability and reasonably small time truncation errors using a time step of 20 min; however, substepping is only required for the precipitation microphysical processes rather than the entire scheme. A new numerical approach for the diagnostic rain and snow produces reasonable results compared to a benchmark simulation, especially at low vertical resolution. Part II of this study details results of the scheme in single-column and global simulations, including comparison with observations. }

    abstract = { Abstract The NCAR Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3) exhibits persistent errors in its simulation of the El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) mode of coupled variability. The amplitude of the oscillation is too strong, the dominant 2-yr period too regular, and the width of the sea surface temperature response in the Pacific too narrow, with positive anomalies extending too far into the western Pacific. Two changes in the parameterization of deep convection result in a significant improvement to many aspects of the ENSO simulation. The inclusion of convective momentum transport (CMT) and a dilution approximation for the calculation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) are used in development integrations, and a striking improvement in ENSO characteristics is seen. An increase in the periodicity of ENSO is achieved by a reduction in the strength of the existing â€œshort-circuitedâ€ delayed-oscillator mode. The off-equatorial response is weaker and less tropically confined, largely as a result of the CMT and an associated redistribution of zonal momentum. The Pacific eastâ€“west structure is improved in response to the presence of convective dilution and cooling provided by increased surface fluxes. The initiation of El NiÃ±o events is fundamentally different. Enhanced intraseasonal surface stress variability leads to absolute surface westerlies and a coolingâ€“warming dipole between the Philippine Sea and western Pacific. Lag-regression analysis shows that intraseasonal variability may play a significant role in event initiation and maintenance as opposed to being a benign response to increased SSTs. Recent observational evidence appears to support such a leading relationship. }

    abstract = { Abstract This work describes a new climatology of cloud liquid water path (LWP), termed the University of Wisconsin (UWisc) climatology, derived from 18 yr of satellite-based passive microwave observations over the global oceans. The climatology is based on a modern retrieval methodology applied consistently to the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR) for Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E) microwave sensors on eight different satellite platforms, beginning in 1988 and continuing through 2005. It goes beyond previously published climatologies by explicitly solving for the diurnal cycle of cloud liquid water by providing statistical error estimates, and includes a detailed discussion of possible systematic errors. A novel methodology for constructing the climatology is used in which a mean monthly diurnal cycle as well as monthly means of the liquid water path are derived simultaneously from the data on a 1Â° grid; the methodology also produces statistical errors for these quantities, which decrease toward the end of the time record as the number of observations increases. The derived diurnal cycles are consistent with previous findings in the tropics, but are also derived for higher latitudes and contain more information than in previous studies. The new climatology exhibits differences with previous observationally based climatologies and is found to be more consistent with the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) than are the previous climatologies. Potential systematic errors of the order of 15\%â€“30\% or higher exist in the LWP climatology. A previously unexplored source of systematic error is caused by the assumption that all microwave-based retrievals of LWP must make regarding the partitioning of cloud water and rainwater, which cannot be determined using microwave observations alone. The potentially large systematic errors that result may hamper the usefulness of microwave-based climatologies of both cloud liquid water and especially rain rate, particularly in certain regions of the tropics and midlatitudes where the separation of rain from liquid cloud water is most critical. }

    abstract = { Abstract This paper describes a new version of the University of Washington shallow cumulus parameterization. The new version includes improved treatments of lateral mixing rates into cumulus updrafts, the evaporation of precipitation and of the interaction of cumuli with the underlying subcloud layer, and a treatment of the convective inhibition-based mass-flux closure that is more numerically stable and is suitable for the long time steps of global climate models. The paper also documents its performance when combined with a new moist turbulence parameterization in simulations with version 3.5 of the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM3.5). A single-column simulation of nonprecipitating trade cumulus shows considerable improvements in vertical thermodynamic structure and less resolution sensitivity in the new schemes compared to CAM3.5. In global simulations, the new schemes, combined with an increase of vertical resolution from 26 to 30 levels, produce a significant (7\%) reduction in overall climate bias, calculated from root-mean-squared error of the seasonal model climatology compared to a suite of global observations of various fields. Biases in almost all fields, particularly the shortwave cloud radiative forcing, are reduced. Geographical bias patterns in surface rainfall, liquid water path, and surface air temperature are only mildly affected by the model parameterization and vertical resolution changes. }

    abstract = { AbstractThis paper provides a description of the integrated representation for the cloud processes in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5). CAM5 cloud parameterizations add the following unique characteristics to previous versions: 1) a cloud macrophysical structure with horizontally nonoverlapped deep cumulus, shallow cumulus, and stratus in each grid layer, where each of which has its own cloud fraction, and mass and number concentrations for cloud liquid droplets and ice crystals; 2) stratusâ€“radiationâ€“turbulence interactions that allow CAM5 to simulate marine stratocumulus solely from grid-mean relative humidity without relying on a stability-based empirical formula; 3) prognostic treatment of the number concentrations of stratus liquid droplets and ice crystals, with activated aerosols and detrained in-cumulus condensates as the main sources and with evaporation, sedimentation, and precipitation of stratus condensate as the main sinks; and 4) radiatively active cumulus and snow. By imposing consistency between diagnosed stratus fraction and prognosed stratus condensate, unrealistically empty or highly dense stratus is avoided in CAM5. Because of the activation of the prognostic aerosols and the parameterizations of the radiation and stratiform precipitation production as a function of the cloud droplet size, CAM5 simulates various aerosol indirect effects as well as the direct effects: that is, aerosols affect both the radiation budget and the hydrological cycle.Detailed analysis of various simulations indicates that CAM5 improves upon CAM3/CAM4 in global performance as well as in physical formulation. However, several problems are also identified in CAM5, which can be attributed to deficient regional tuning, inconsistency between various physics parameterizations, and incomplete treatment of physics. Efforts are continuing to further improve CAM5. }

Quantitative estimates of the global distributions of cloud-radiative forcing have been obtained from the spaceborne Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) launched in 1984. For the April 1985 period, the global shortwave cloud forcing [-44.5 watts per square meter (W/m2)] due to the enhancement of planetary albedo, exceeded in magnitude the longwave cloud forcing (31.3 W/m2) resulting from the greenhouse effect of clouds. Thus, clouds had a net cooling effect on the earth. This cooling effect is large over the mid-and high-latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 W/m2. The monthly averaged longwave cloud forcing reached maximum values of 50 to 100 W/m2 over the convectively disturbed regions of the tropics. However, this heating effect is nearly canceled by a correspondingly large negative shortwave cloud forcing, which indicates the delicately balanced state of the tropics. The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling. Hence, small changes in the cloud-radiative forcing fields can play a significant role as a climate feedback mechanism. For example, during past glaciations a migration toward the equator of the field of strong, negative cloud-radiative forcing, in response to a similar migration of cooler waters, could have significantly amplified oceanic cooling and continental glaciation.},

    abstract = { Abstract A comprehensive and accurate global water vapor dataset is critical to the adequate understanding of water vapor's role in the earth's climate system. To begin to satisfy this need, the authors have produced a blended dataset made up of global, 5-yr (1988â€“92), 1Â° Ã— 1Â° spatial resolution, atmospheric water vapor (WV) and liquid water path products. These new products consist of both the daily total column-integrated composites and a multilayered WV product at three layers (1000â€“700, 700â€“500, 500â€“300 mb). The analyses combine WV retrievals from the Television and Infrared Operational Satellite (TIROS) Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager, and radiosonde observations. The global, vertical-layered water vapor dataset was developed by slicing the blended total column water vapor using layer information from TOVS and radiosonde. Also produced was a companion, over oceans only, liquid water path dataset. Satellite observations of liquid water path are growing in importance since many of the global climate models are now either incorporating or contain liquid water as an explicit variable. The complete dataset (all three products) has been named NVAP, an acronym for National Aeronautics and Space Administration Water Vapor Project. This paper provides examples of the new dataset as well as scientific analysis of the observed annual cycle and the interannual variability of water vapor at global, hemispheric, and regional scales. A distinct global annual cycle is shown to be dominated by the Northern Hemisphere observations. Planetary-scale variations are found to relate well to recent independent estimates of tropospheric temperature variations. Maps of regional interannual variability in the 5-yr period show the effect of the 1992 ENSO and other features. }

The model began as a fork of the well-known Community Atmosphere Model, but it has evolved in new ways, and coding, performance, resolution, physical processes (primarily cloud and aerosols formulations), testing and development procedures now differ significantly. Vertical resolution was increased (from 30 to 72 layers), and the model top extended to 60 km (~0.1 hPa). A simple ozone photochemistry predicts stratospheric ozone, and the model now supports increased and more realistic variability in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. An optional improved treatment of light-absorbing particle deposition to snowpack and ice is available, and stronger connections with Earth system biogeochemistry can be used for some science problems. Satellite and ground-based cloud and aerosol simulators were implemented to facilitate evaluation of clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions. Higher horizontal and vertical resolution, increased complexity, and more predicted and transported variables have increased the model computational cost and changed the simulations considerably. These changes required development of alternate strategies for tuning and evaluation as it was not feasible to ?brute force? tune the high-resolution configurations, so short-term hindcasts, perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, and regionally refined simulations provided guidance on tuning and parameterization sensitivity to higher resolution. A brief overview of the model and model climate is provided. Model fidelity has generally improved compared to its predecessors and the CMIP5 generation of climate models.},

    abstract = { Abstract Transport of momentum by convection is an important process affecting global circulation. Owing to the lack of global observations, the quantification of the impact of this process on the tropospheric climate is difficult. Here an implementation of two convective momentum transport parameterizations, presented by Schneider and Lindzen and Gregory et al., in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM3) is presented, and their effect on global climate is examined in detail. An analysis of the tropospheric zonal momentum budget reveals that convective momentum transport affects tropospheric climate mainly through changes to the Coriolis torque. These changes result in improvement of the representation of the Hadley circulation: in Decemberâ€“February, the upward branch of the circulation is weakened in the Northern Hemisphere and strengthened in the Southern Hemisphere, and the lower northerly branch is weakened. In Juneâ€“August, similar improvements are noted. The inclusion of convective momentum transport in CAM3 reduces many of the modelâ€™s biases in the representation of surface winds, as well as in the representation of tropical convection. In an annual mean, the tropical easterly bias, subtropical westerly bias, and the bias in the 60Â°S jet are improved. Representation of convection is improved along the equatorial belt with decreased precipitation in the Indian Ocean and increased precipitation in the western Pacific. The improvements of the representation of tropospheric climate are greater with the implementation of the Schneider and Lindzen parameterization. }

    abstract = { Abstract Middle atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs) must employ a parameterization for small-scale gravity waves (GWs). Such parameterizations typically make very simple assumptions about gravity wave sources, such as uniform distribution in space and time or an arbitrarily specified GW source function. The authors present a configuration of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) that replaces the arbitrarily specified GW source spectrum with GW source parameterizations. For the nonorographic wave sources, a frontal system and convective GW source parameterization are used. These parameterizations link GW generation to tropospheric quantities calculated by the GCM and provide a model-consistent GW representation. With the new GW source parameterization, a reasonable middle atmospheric circulation can be obtained and the middle atmospheric circulation is better in several respects than that generated by a typical GW source specification. In particular, the interannual NH stratospheric variability is significantly improved as a result of the source-oriented GW parameterization. It is also shown that the addition of a parameterization to estimate mountain stress due to unresolved orography has a large effect on the frequency of stratospheric sudden warmings in the NH stratosphere by changing the propagation of stationary planetary waves into the polar vortex. }

    abstract = { AbstractThe traditional forcingâ€“feedback framework has provided an indispensable basis for discussing global climate changes. However, as analysis of model behavior has become more detailed, shortcomings and ambiguities in the framework have become more evident, and physical effects unaccounted for by the traditional framework have become interesting. In particular, the new concept of adjustments, which are responses to forcings that are not mediated by the global-mean temperature, has emerged. This concept, related to the older ones of climate efficacy and stratospheric adjustment, is a more physical way of capturing unique responses to specific forcings. We present a pedagogical review of the adjustment concept, why it is important, and how it can be used. The concept is particularly useful for aerosols, where it helps to organize what has become a complex array of forcing mechanisms. It also helps clarify issues around cloud and hydrological response, transient versus equilibrium climate change, and geoengineering. }

    abstract = { Abstract Four schemes (referred to here as explicit, implicit, split-implicit, and symmetrized split-implicit) for coupling physics parameterizations to the dynamical core of numerical weather and climate prediction models have been studied in the context of a simplified, canonical model problem. This problem models the dynamics by a representation of the terms responsible for gravitational oscillations and models the physics by both a constant forcing term and a linear damping term, representative of horizontal or vertical diffusion. The schemes have been analyzed in terms of their numerical stability and accuracy. Two of the schemes (the explicit and split-implicit) have been studied previously in the context of a three-time-level discretization. Those results are confirmed here for a two-time-level discretization. The two other schemes (the implicit and the novel symmetrized split-implicit) are both found to be second-order accurate and unconditionally stable, and both represent improvements over the explicit and split-implicit schemes. The symmetrized split-implicit has the additional advantage over the implicit scheme, for simplicity and computational efficiency, of separating the physics and dynamics steps from each other. The canonical problem considered here is a considerable simplification of any real physicsâ€“dynamics coupling, which limits the generality of the conclusions drawn. However, such simplification allows detailed analysis of some important aspects and motivates further work on both broadening and deepening understanding of physicsâ€“dynamics coupling issues. }

    abstract = { Abstract This paper examines the controls on global precipitation that are evident in the transient experiments conducted using coupled climate models collected for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The change in precipitation, water vapor, clouds, and radiative heating of the atmosphere evident in the 1\% increase in carbon dioxide until doubled (1pctto2x) scenario is examined. As noted in other studies, the ensemble-mean changes in water vapor as carbon dioxide is doubled occur at a rate similar to that predicted by the Clausius--Clapeyron relationship. The ratio of global changes in precipitation to global changes in water vapor offers some insight on how readily increased water vapor is converted into precipitation in modeled climate change. This ratio Îµ is introduced in this paper as a gross indicator of the global precipitation efficiency under global warming. The main findings of this paper are threefold. First, increases in the global precipitation track increase atmospheric radiative energy loss and the ratio of precipitation sensitivity to water vapor sensitivity is primarily determined by changes to this atmospheric column energy loss. A reference limit to this ratio is introduced as the rate at which the emission of radiation from the clear-sky atmosphere increases as water vapor increases. It is shown that the derived efficiency based on the simple ratio of precipitation to water vapor sensitivities of models in fact closely matches the sensitivity derived from simple energy balance arguments involving changes to water vapor emission alone. Second, although the rate of increase of clear-sky emission is the dominant factor in the change to the energy balance of the atmosphere, there are two important and offsetting processes that contribute to Îµ in the model simulations studied: One involves a negative feedback through cloud radiative heating that acts to reduce the efficiency; the other is the global reduction in sensible heating that counteracts the effects of the cloud feedback and increases the efficiency. These counteracting feedbacks only apply on the global scale. Third, the negative cloud radiative heating feedback occurs through reductions of cloud amount in the middle troposphere, defined as the layer between 680 and 440 hPa, and by slight global cloud decreases in the lower troposphere. These changes act in a manner to expose the warmer atmosphere below to high clouds, thus resulting in a net warming of the atmospheric column by clouds and a negative feedback on the precipitation. }

abstract = {A diagram has been devised that can provide a concise statistical summary of how well patterns match each other in terms of their correlation, their root-mean-square difference, and the ratio of their variances. Although the form of this diagram is general, it is especially useful in evaluating complex models, such as those used to study geophysical phenomena. Examples are given showing that the diagram can be used to summarize the relative merits of a collection of different models or to track changes in performance of a model as it is modified. Methods are suggested for indicating on these diagrams the statistical significance of apparent differences and the degree to which observational uncertainty and unforced internal variability limit the expected agreement between model-simulated and observed behaviors. The geometric relationship between the statistics plotted on the diagram also provides some guidance for devising skill scores that appropriately weight among the various measures of pattern correspondence.},

    abstract = { Abstract Feedback analysis in climate models commonly involves decomposing any change in the system?s energy balance into radiative forcing terms due to prescribed changes, and response terms due to the radiative effects of changes in model variables such as temperature, water vapor, clouds, sea ice, and snow. The established ?partial radiative perturbation? (PRP) method allows an accurate separation of these terms, but requires processing large volumes of model output with an offline version of the model?s radiation code. Here, we propose an ?approximate PRP? (APRP) method for the shortwave that provides an accurate estimate of the radiative perturbation, but derived from a quite modest amount of monthly mean model output. The APRP method is based on a simplified shortwave radiative model of the atmosphere, where surface absorption and atmospheric scattering and absorption are represented by means of three parameters that are diagnosed for overcast and clear-sky portions of each model grid cell. The accuracy of the method is gauged relative to full PRP calculations in two experiments: one in which carbon dioxide concentration is doubled and another in which conditions of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) are simulated. The approximate PRP method yields a shortwave cloud feedback accurate in the global mean to within 7\%. Forcings and feedbacks due to surface albedo and noncloud atmospheric constituents are also well approximated with errors of order 5\%?10\%. Comparison of two different model simulations of the LGM shows that the regional and global differences in their ice sheet albedo forcing fields are clearly captured by the APRP method. Hence this method is an efficient and satisfactory tool for studying and intercomparing shortwave forcing and feedbacks in climate models. }

    abstract = { Abstract The influence of the cloud feedback process upon the sensitivity of climate is investigated by comparing the behavior of two versions of a climate model with predicted and prescribed cloud cover. The model used for this study is a general circulation model of the atmosphere coupled with a mixed layer model of the oceans. The sensitivity of each version of the model is inferred from the equilibrium response of the model to a doubling of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide. It is found that the cloud feedback process in the present model enhances the sensitivity of the model climate. In response to the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide, cloudiness increases around the tropopause and is reduced in the upper troposphere, thereby raising the height of the cloud layer in the upper troposphere. This rise of the high cloud layer implies a reduction of the temperature of the cloud top and, accordingly, of the upward terrestrial radiation from the top of the model atmosphere. Thus, the heat loss from the atmosphere-earth system of the model is reduced. As the high cloud layer rises, the vertical distribution of cloudiness changes, thereby affecting the absorption of solar radiation by the model atmosphere. At most latitudes the effect of reduced cloud amount in the upper troposphere overshadows that of increased cloudiness around the tropopause, thereby lowering the global mean planetary albedo and enhancing the CO2 induced warming. On the other hand, the increase of low cloudiness in high latitudes raises the planetary albedo and thus decreases the CO2 induced warming of climate. However, the contribution of this negative feedback process is much smaller than the effect of the positive feedback process involving the change of high cloud. The model used here does not take into consideration the possible change in the optical properties of clouds due to the change of their liquid water content. In view of the extreme idealization in the formulation of the cloud feedback process in the model, this study should be regarded as a study of the mechanisms involved in this process rather than the quantitative assessment of its influence on the sensitivity of climate. }

abstract = {Abstract This study provides comprehensive insight into the notable differences in clouds and precipitation simulated by the Energy Exascale Earth System Model Atmosphere Model version 0 and version 1 (EAMv1). Several sensitivity experiments are conducted to isolate the impact of changes in model physics, resolution, and parameter choices on these differences. The overall improvement in EAMv1 clouds and precipitation is primarily attributed to the introduction of a simplified third-order turbulence parameterization Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals (along with the companion changes) for a unified treatment of boundary layer turbulence, shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics, though it also leads to a reduction in subtropical coastal stratocumulus clouds. This lack of stratocumulus clouds is considerably improved by increasing vertical resolution from 30 to 72 layers, but the gain is unfortunately subsequently offset by other retuning to reach the top-of-atmosphere energy balance. Increasing vertical resolution also results in a considerable underestimation of high clouds over the tropical warm pool, primarily due to the selection for numerical stability of a higher air parcel launch level in the deep convection scheme. Increasing horizontal resolution from 1 to 0.25 without retuning leads to considerable degradation in cloud and precipitation fields, with much weaker tropical and subtropical short- and longwave cloud radiative forcing and much stronger precipitation in the intertropical convergence zone, indicating poor scale awareness of the cloud parameterizations. To avoid this degradation, significantly different parameter settings for the low-resolution (1) and high-resolution (0.25) were required to achieve optimal performance in EAMv1.},

    abstract = { AbstractUsing five climate model simulations of the response to an abrupt quadrupling of CO2, the authors perform the first simultaneous model intercomparison of cloud feedbacks and rapid radiative adjustments with cloud masking effects removed, partitioned among changes in cloud types and gross cloud properties. Upon CO2 quadrupling, clouds exhibit a rapid reduction in fractional coverage, cloud-top pressure, and optical depth, with each contributing equally to a 1.1 W m?2 net cloud radiative adjustment, primarily from shortwave radiation. Rapid reductions in midlevel clouds and optically thick clouds are important in reducing planetary albedo in every model. As the planet warms, clouds become fewer, higher, and thicker, and global mean net cloud feedback is positive in all but one model and results primarily from increased trapping of longwave radiation. As was true for earlier models, high cloud changes are the largest contributor to intermodel spread in longwave and shortwave cloud feedbacks, but low cloud changes are the largest contributor to the mean and spread in net cloud feedback. The importance of the negative optical depth feedback relative to the amount feedback at high latitudes is even more marked than in earlier models. The authors show that the negative longwave cloud adjustment inferred in previous studies is primarily caused by a 1.3 W m?2 cloud masking of CO2 forcing. Properly accounting for cloud masking increases net cloud feedback by 0.3 W m?2 K?1, whereas accounting for rapid adjustments reduces by 0.14 W m?2 K?1 the ensemble mean net cloud feedback through a combination of smaller positive cloud amount and altitude feedbacks and larger negative optical depth feedbacks. }

abstractNote = {The conservation of total water is an important numerical feature for global Earth system models. Even small conservation problems in the water budget can lead to systematic errors in century-long simulations. This study quantifies and reduces various sources of water conservation error in the atmosphere component of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model. Several sources of water conservation error have been identified during the development of the version 1 (V1) model. The largest errors result from the numerical coupling between the resolved dynamics and the parameterized sub-grid physics. A hybrid coupling using different methods for fluid dynamics and tracer transport provides a reduction of water conservation error by a factor of 50 at 1 horizontal resolution as well as consistent improvements at other resolutions. The second largest error source is the use of an overly simplified relationship between the surface moisture flux and latent heat flux at the interface between the host model and the turbulence parameterization. This error can be prevented by applying the same (correct) relationship throughout the entire model. Two additional types of conservation error that result from correcting the surface moisture flux and clipping negative water concentrations can be avoided by using mass-conserving fixers. With all four error sources addressed, the water conservation error in the V1 model becomes negligible and insensitive to the horizontal resolution. The associated changes in the long-term statistics of the main atmospheric features are small. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to show that the magnitudes of the conservation errors in early V1 versions decrease strongly with temporal resolution but increase with horizontal resolution. The increased vertical resolution in V1 results in a very thin model layer at the Earth's surface, which amplifies the conservation error associated with the surface moisture flux correction. We note that for some of the identified error sources, the proposed fixers are remedies rather than solutions to the problems at their roots. Future improvements in time integration would be beneficial for V1.},

    abstract = { Abstract This study investigates the physical mechanism of low cloud feedback in the Community Atmospheric Model, version 3 (CAM3) through idealized single-column model (SCM) experiments over the subtropical eastern oceans. Negative cloud feedback is simulated from stratus and stratocumulus that is consistent with previous diagnostics of cloud feedbacks in CAM3 and its predecessor versions. The feedback occurs through the interaction of a suite of parameterized processes rather than from any single process. It is caused by the larger amount of in-cloud liquid water in stratus clouds from convective sources, and longer lifetimes of these clouds in a warmer climate through their interaction with boundary layer turbulence. Thermodynamic effects are found to dominate the negative cloud feedback in the model. The dynamic effect of weaker subsidence in a warmer climate also contributes to the negative cloud feedback, but with about one-quarter of the magnitude of the thermodynamic effect, owing to increased low-level convection in a warmer climate. }
