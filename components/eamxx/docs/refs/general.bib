abstract = {Abstract An ‘effective’ roughness length is defined for use over heterogeneous terrain as the roughness length which homogeneous terrain would have to give the correct surface stress over a given area. A method is suggested to compute geostrophic drag coefficient, wind-contour angle and surface heat flux, given this roughness length, latitude, geostrophic wind speed and insolation or ground-air temperature differences.},
