This version of ice_scidoc.tex is Bruce's TEX version of the
model description.  To get the dvi file, I typed tex ice_scidoc.tex.
I put this file in the repository so I know where to find it next time
the scientific documentation needs to be rewritten.  It should be
rewritten in latex, and have an html readable version.  Also, the
references can be removed from the text, and master_list.bib can
be used.  The Makefile won't work with this file.  The .tex file
originated in /home/bruceb/ccsm/csimpap/ccsm3seaice/ccsm3_description.
