The coupled CICE model requires a minimum of three files to run:

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf global\_\$\{ICE\_GRID\}.grid} is a binary file containing
        grid information
  \item {\bf global\_\$\{ICE\_GRID\}.kmt} is a binary file containing
        land mask information
  \item {\bf iced.0001-01-01.\$\{ICE\_GRID\}.20lay}
         are binary files containing initial condition information 
         for the gx1v6 and gx3v7 grids, respectively. The thickness 
         distribution in this restart file contains 5 categories, each 
         with 4 layers.
\end{itemize}

Depending on the grid selected in the scripts, the appropriate {\bf global*}
and {\bf iced*} files will be used in the executable directory. These files
are read directory from the system input data directory and not copied
to the executable directory.  Currently, only gx3v7, gx1v6, tx1v1, and tx0.1v2 
grids are supported for the ice and ocean models.  Note that these files can
now be used in netCDF format. \\
