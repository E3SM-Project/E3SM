  Notes for Overflow Info file: First line total number of overflows. Then follows     3
  blocks of lines having the same logical structure, one for each overflow. Each       4
  overflow block starts with the number of the overflow, then a character descriptor.  5
  The next seven lines are parameters specific to each overflow; note that the order   6
  is important. Next block is for kmt changes; note, first line should be set to 0     7
  if there are no kmt changes; each kmt change is i,j, old and new kmt indices. Next   8
  block gives the inflow, source and entrainment regional average index boundaries,    9
  after a blank comment line; each line is imin,imax,jmin,jmax,kmin,kmax. Next block  10
  is the source grid box ijk values and sidewall orientation, with the first line the 11
  number of boxes, followed by each ijk and orientation value, ordered to increase in 12
  i or j, whichever is appropriate. Then follows entrainment grid box ijk and orienta-13
  tion, similar to source, and finally the product grid boxes. Product grid boxes     14
  have one or more sets ordered by increasing k (i.e. depth), one for each group of   15
  gridboxes; first the number of product sets, then each set as number, ijk and       16
  orientation.                                                                        17
                                  Conventions                                         18
                                                                                      19
  Source (src) and entrainment (ent) grid values refer to the grid box that the       20
  overflows flow INTO; product (prd) grid values refer to the grid box from which     21
  the overflow flows OUT OF. All indices refer to the POP T-grid. All of the overflow 22
  grid boxes (i.e. ijk values) are below the bottom topography but have sidewalls     23
  adjacent to active ocean points from which overflow waters flow from or into.       24
                                                                                      25
  Orientation of overflow sidewalls: 1=increasing x direction, 2=increasing y         26
  direction, 3=decreasing x direction and 4=decreasing y direction. As src,ent always 27
  flow INTO an overflow gridbox and prd flows OUT, there should be no ambiguity. (!)  28
