! Users should add all user specific namelist changes after these comments 
! in the form of 
!   namelist_var = new_namelist_value 
! *** EXCEPT FOR ***
! 1. DO NOT CHANGE iyear0, imonth0, iday0, ihour0 
! 2. DO NOT CHANGE any tavg_nml namelist variables below - copy any of the files
!      $CODEROOT/ocn/pop2/input_templates/ocn.base.tavg.csh  
!      $CODEROOT/ocn/pop2/input_templates/ocn.ecosys.tavg.csh  
!      $CODEROOT/ocn/pop2/input_templates/ocn.iage.tavg.csh  
!      $CODEROOT/ocn/pop2/input_templates/ocn.cfc.tavg.csh  
!    into $CASEROOT/SourceMods/src.pop2 and edit them there. Invoke preview-namelist
!    to see the changes in CaseDocs/pop2_in
! Also
! 3. WARNING: The present code makes assumptions about the region boundaries -- 
!    do not change transport_reg2_names unless you know exactly what you are doing
! 4. NOTE: a handful of pop2 namelist variabes have the same names in multiple pop2 
!    namelists - these are the following
!      ah              (hmix_del4t_nml, hmix_del2t_nml, hmix_gm_nml)
!      am              (hmix_del4u_nml, hmix_del2u_nml)
!      lauto_hmix      (hmix_del4t_nml, hmix_del2t_nml,
!                       hmix_del4u_nml, hmix_del2u_nml)
!      lvariable_hmix  (hmix_del4t_nml, hmix_del2t_nml, 
!                       hmix_del4u_nml, hmix_del2u_nml)
!      rich_mix        ( vmix_rich_nml,   vmix_kpp_nml)
!      tracer_init_ext (    ecosys_nml,       iage_nml,     cfc_nml)
!      gas_flux_fice   (    ecosys_nml,        cfc_nml)
!      gas_flux_ws     (    ecosys_nml,        cfc_nml)
!      gas_flux_ap     (    ecosys_nml,        cfc_nml)
!
!    If any of the above are to be modified here namelist_var shoud be as follows    
!      ah => ah&hmix_del4t_nml, ah&hmix_del2t_nml, ah&hmix_gm_nml  
!      am => am&hmix_del4u_nml, am&hmix_del2u_nml  
!      lauto_hmix => lauto_hmix&del4t_nml, lauto_hmix&del2t_nml, 
!                    lauto_hmix&del4u_nml, lauto_hmix&del2u_nml
!      lvariable_hmix => lvariable_hmix&del4t_nml, lvariable_hmix&del2t_nml, 
!                        lvariable_hmix&del4u_nml, lvariable_hmix&del2u_nml
!      rich_mix => rich_mix&vmix_rich_nml, rich_mix&vmix_kpp_nml  
!
!    Example - if you change the default value of ah to 0.7e7 in the
!    namelist hmix_del2t - you would add the following line below
!      ah&hmix_del2t_nml = 0.7e7
!
!    Note that tracer_init_ext, gas_flux_fice, gas_glux_ws, and gas_flux_ap are
!    Fortran derived types, so you also need to specify their components (and
!    tracer_init_ext is an array, to further complicate things). For example
!      tracer_init_ext(5)%scale_factor&ecosys_nml = 1.1
!      gas_flux_ap%default_val&cfc_nml = 0
! 4. To preview the namelists, invoke $CASEROOT preview-namelists and look at 
!    $CASEROOT/CaseDocs/pop2_in
