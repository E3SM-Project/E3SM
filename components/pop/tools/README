The subdirectories in tools/ are intended to contain scripts, programs,
and other files that are used in connection with the initialization, setup,
or post-run processing of pop2 files.

Not all such scripts reside here, mainly for historical reasons.  Other possible
script locations include the input_templates/ and bld/ directories.
