MOSART is the river model of E3SM. It routes the runoff genrated by ELM and provides freshwater input to the ocean model.

* The [MOSART User Guide](user-guide/index.md) explains how to control MOSART when its running within E3SM
* The [MOSART Developer Guide](dev-guide/index.md) explains MOSART data structures and how to develop new code.
* The [MOSART Technical Guide](tech-guide/index.md) explains the science behind MOSART's code
