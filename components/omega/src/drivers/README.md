# OMEGA src/drivers directory

This directory contains the source code for the
top-level drivers of the Ocean Model for E3SM Global
Applications (OMEGA). It includes a driver for ocean
simulations in standalone mode (OMEGA's main) as well
as the coupling interface for running OMEGA in coupled
mode within E3SM.
