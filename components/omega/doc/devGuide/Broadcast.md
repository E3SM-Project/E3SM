# Omega Broadcast

## Code Structure

Omega Broadcasting functions are organized within two primary files:

1. **Header File**: Located at `src/base/Broadcast.h`, this file declares
   various functions of the `Broadcast`. These functions are
   distinctively overloaded to accommodate multiple broadcasting needs.
   The key differentiators for these overloads are based on:
    - The types of variables being broadcasted.
    - The specific ordering of function arguments.

2. **Implementation File**: The actual implementations of these declared
   functions are found in `src/base/Broadcast.cpp`.

## IBroadcast Interface

Parallel to `Broadcast`, there is the `IBroadcast` interface. Currently under
development, `IBroadcast` focuses on overloading functions for non-blocking
broadcast operations. This aspect of the Omega Broadcasting system is
designed to provide more efficient and asynchronous communication capabilities.

## Integration with MPI

At their core, the Omega broadcast functions serve as wrappers around
the MPI (Message Passing Interface) broadcast functions. They are
intricately designed to:
- Retrieve values from the Omega Environment.
- Utilize Omega-specific data types.
- Seamlessly feed these values into the standard MPI functions for
effective broadcasting.
