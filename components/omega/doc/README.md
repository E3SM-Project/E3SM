# Omega doc directory

This directory stores source files for various forms of documentation
for the Ocean Model for E3SM Global Applications (Omega). Currently,
these are stored in three subdirectories for software requirements and
design (design), a User's Guide (userGuide) and a reference manual or
developer's guide (devGuide). These sources are generally built for
display through ReadTheDocs or other mechanisms but are often in
restructuredText format so can be readable individually.
