## Tendencies

The `Tendencies` class provides a container for the [tendency terms](#omega-user-tend-terms) in OMEGA.
Upon creation of an `Tendencies` instance, these functors are initialized and arrays for the
accumulated tendencies are allocated.
There are no user-configurable options beyond those for the tendency term functors.
