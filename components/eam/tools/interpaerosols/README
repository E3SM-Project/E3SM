Typing "gmake" in this directory will build an executable named
interpaerosols that can be used to generate a resolution-specific aerosol
mass dataset suitable for input to CAM.  Required command-line arguments to
interpaerosols are 1) input "master" aerosol netcdf dataset on a rectangular
grid; 2) input/output template netcdf dataset on the target CAM grid.  On
output this second dataset will contain horizontally interpolated and
vertically summed versions of the input fields.  Optionally, the -d argument
can be included which will produce 64-bit output fields.  The default is
32-bit fields.  At this writing the most current master aerosol mass dataset
is named AerosolMass_192x94_L28_clim_c030418.nc and lives in
/fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/atm/cam2/rad.

Perl script REGRID.pl is included to enable easy creation of the
template dataset at a specific resolution.  Usage of the perl script is:
REGRID.pl <resolution>, where currently supported resolutions can be found by
running the script without arguments.  The output netcdf file will be named
regrid.<resolution>.nc.  An example sequence of steps to create
a T42 aerosol dataset for input to CAM would be:

REGRID.pl T42
gmake
./interpaerosols /fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/atm/cam2/rad/AerosolMass_192x94_L28_clim_c030418.nc \
                 regrid.T42.nc
