# OCEANFILMS

## Overview

E3SM (v1-v3) uses the OCEANFILMS (Organic Compounds from Ecosystems to Aerosols: Natural Films and Interfaces via Langmuir Molecular Surfactants) parameterization to represent sea spray organic aerosol emissions.  OCEANFILMS is a physically based model that links sea spray chemistry with ocean biogeochemistry using a Langmuir partitioning approach.  The underlying physical assumptions and parameterization are described in Burrows et al. (2014);[@burrows_physically_2014] the implementation in E3SM and impact on clouds and climate are documented in Burrows et al. (2022).[@burrows_oceanfilms_2022]
