# chemUCI and Linoz

## Overview

Atmospheric interactive chemistry is handled by chemUCI (in the troposphere) and Linoz v3 (in the stratosphere). chemUCI consists of 28 advected tracers for the O3-CH4-HOx-NOx-NMVOCs chemistry. Compared to E3SMv2, the E3SMv3 linearized stratospheric chemistry scheme (Linoz v3) expends the interactive species to include O3, N2O, NOy, and CH4. The boundary between stratosphere and troposphere adopts the e90 tropopause algorithm.
