# Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals

## Overview

The Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals (CLUBB) parameterization is a parameterization of subgrid-scale turbulence and clouds.[@larson_clubb-silhs_2022,@bogenschutz_path_2018,@larson_using_2005,@golaz_pdf-based_2002] It prognoses turbulent fluxes of heat, moisture, and momentum, and it diagnoses the liquid cloud fraction and liquid water mixing ratio.  To do so, it prognoses higher-order turbulence moments and closes those prognostic equations by use of an assumed double-Gaussian shape of the subgrid probability density function.  CLUBB operates throughout the troposphere, but it contributes especially to the planetary boundary layer and low-cloud regimes, including stratocumulus and shallow cumulus regimes.
