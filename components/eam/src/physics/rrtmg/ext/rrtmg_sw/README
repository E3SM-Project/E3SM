******************************************************************************

This package contains the source code and sample makefiles necessary to run the
latest version of RRTMG_SW, a correlated k-distribution shortwave radiative transfer 
model developed at AER, Inc. for application to GCMs.  This version of RRTMG_SW 
utilizes a two-stream radiative transfer method as implemented at ECMWF. This
code has also been modified to utilize FORTRAN90 coding features. Two modes of
operation are possible.  RRTMG_SW can be run in stand-alone mode using the 
input files and source modules described below, or it can be attached to an 
atmospheric general circulation model as a callable subroutine. 

The version of RRTMG_SW provided here utilizes a reduced complement of 112 
g-points, which is half of the 224 g-points used in the standard RRTM_SW, and
a two-stream method for radiative transfer. Additional minor changes have been 
made to enhance computational performance.  Total fluxes are accurate to within 
1-2 W/m2 relative to the standard RRTM_SW (using DISORT) in clear sky and in the
presence of aerosols and within 6 W/m2 in overcast sky.  RRTM_SW with DISORT is
itself accurate to within 2 W/m2 of the data-validated multiple scattering 
model, CHARTS.  

This model can also utilize McICA, the Monte-Carlo Independent Column 
Approximation, to represent sub-grid scale cloud variability such as cloud 
fraction and cloud overlap.  If the McICA option is selected to model a cloudy 
profile in column mode, then the model will run stochastically, and the output 
fluxes and heating rates will be an average over 200 samples.  Without McICA,
RRTMG_SW is limited to clear sky or overcast cloud conditions.

Notes regarding GCM version:

   1) The module rrtmg_sw_init.f90 is the initialization routine that has to be 
      called only once.  The call to this subroutine should be moved to the 
      initialization section of the host model if RRTMG_SW is called by a GCM or SCM. 

   2) The number of model layers and the number of columns to be looped over should
      be passed into RRTMG_SW through the subroutine call along with the other model
      profile arrays.

   3) To utilize McICA, the sub-column generator (mcica_subcol_gen_sw.f90) must be
      implemented in the GCM so that it is called just before RRTMG.
      If McICA is utilized, this will run only a single statistical sample per
      model grid box.  There are two options for the random number generator used
      with McICA, which is selected with the variable irnd in mcica_subcol_gen_sw.f90.
      When using McICA, the main RRTMG_SW module is rrtmg_sw.f90.  If McICA is not
      used, then the main module is rrtmg_sw.nomcica.f90, though cloud specification
      is limited to overcast clouds.
