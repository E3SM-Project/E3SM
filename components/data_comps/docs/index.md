# Data Models

The E3SM data models are key components to support many different scenarios:

- AMIP style experiments with observed sea surface temperatures
- component model spin-up, such as land forced by atmospheric reanalysis
- idealized experiments, such as aquaplanet or radiative-convective equilibrium

More details can be found for each component below.
