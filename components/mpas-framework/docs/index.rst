MPAS-Model
==========

The Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) is a collaborative project for
developing atmosphere, ocean, and other earth-system simulation components for
use in climate, regional climate, and weather studies. The primary development
partners are the climate modeling group at Los Alamos National Laboratory
(COSIM) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Both primary
partners are responsible for the MPAS framework, operators, and tools common to
the applications; LANL has primary responsibility for the ocean, sea-ice and
land-ice models, and NCAR has primary responsibility for the atmospheric model.

The MPAS framework facilitates the rapid development and prototyping of models
by providing infrastructure typically required by model developers, including
high-level data types, communication routines, and I/O routines. By using MPAS,
developers can leverage pre-existing code and focus more on development of
