\subsection faqitem1 How does a STL container iterator work?
Container iterators are declared as <code><i>containerName</i><type>::iterator <i>iteratorName</i></code>. The iterator then behaves as a pointer
to the item within the container it points at, and pointer operations can be perfomed on it, such as dereferencing. If 
the container held pointers to objects, the iterator must be dereferenced twice in order to access the object.

Example of using an iterator to iterate over a container of objects:<br>
<code>
for( vector<object>::iterator <i>i</i> = <i>objectVector</i>.begin(); i != <i>objectVector</i>.end(); i++ ) {
	<i>i</i>-><i>doSomething()</i>;
}
</code>

Example of using an iterator to iterator over a container of pointers to objects:<br>
<code>
for( vector<object*>::iterator <i>i</i> = <i>pointerVector</i>.begin(); i != <i>pointerVector</i>.end(); i++ ) {
	<i>( *i )</i>-><i>doSomething()</i>;
}
</code>

\subsection faqitem2 When should I forward declare a class?
Forward declaration is a very useful technique for reducing compilation dependencies, but can be difficult to use correctly. Forward declaration
tells the compiler to create a placeholder for the class definition, so that you can define it at a later time. Here is a list of criteria for 
when you can use a forward declaration
<ul>
<li>You are working on a header file.
<li>The class you are trying to forward declare is NOT an STL class.
<li>The only use of the class is a datamember which is a pointer to the class, or the argument to a function.
<li>The header file does not contain any inline functions which use the class or its functions. 
</ul>

If these criteria are met, you may forward declare the class with the line: 
<code>class className</code><br>
Make sure to do this before the class documentation so that doxygen is not confused.

\subsection faqitem3 When should I pass an argument by reference?
C++ supports two different methods of passing arguments, pass-by-value and pass-by-reference. Pass-by-value is the default, in this method
the compiler generates a temporary copy of the argument which is available during the function and then discarded. Pass-by-reference passes
the memory location of the variable, so the original variable can be used in the function. There are two reasons for using pass-by-reference.
<ol>
<li> The function needs to modify and return the original variable. This is often done when a function needs to return multiple values. 
<li> To speed up the execution of the program, the argument can be passed by reference to avoid the copy constructor and destructor caused by
passing by value. This is only effective if the object is non-elemental, or not an int, float, bool, etc. In this case, make sure to declare
the argument const to prevent accidental modification.
</ol>

\subsection faqitem4 What does <code>virtual void <i>function name</i> = 0 </code>mean?
When any function in a header file is declared with an = 0 after the definition, the class is an abstract class. An abstract class cannot 
be instantiated, it is instead used as a base class for other classes. Abstract base classes may have code and member variables. Any function 
which is defined with an =0 in the base class must be defined in the derived class, or the compiler will report an error. Abstract functions
in base classes may have code, but the code is not called by default. It may be called from within the derived function using the syntax
<code><i>BaseClassName</i>::</i>FunctionName()</i></code>.

\subsection faqitem5 When should I declare variables within functions?
In C++, unlike Fortran, it is considered good style to declare variables at the latest possible position in code, unlike Fortran where 
variables are declared in an initial block. This allows a programmer to quickly understand how a variable is both declared and used, minimizes
duplicate initialization and lines of code, and allows the compiler to reuse memory locations when variables go out of scope. The exception to this
rule is when a variable is used in a loop, and the initialization of this variable is expensive. Then the variable should be declared outside the loop. 
This would only apply to vectors, strings, and other large objects. Doubles and integers are very inexpensive to construct, and should be declared within
the loop.

\subsection faqitem6 What does it mean when functions are declared explicit?
The explicit keyword is added to constructors to signify that the constructor may only be called explicitally. This is because when the compiler
sees a comparison between two objects, it is allowed to choose an intermediate single-argument constructor to turn one argument into the other. This is most often
not the desired behavior, and an artifact of a code error. The explicit keyword should be added to single argument constructors to prevent this conversion
from automatically occurring. Constructors with no arguments, or more than one argument are not eligible for conversion, and thus do not have this problem. 
Copy constructors, which are single argument constructors, also do not have this problem as the argument and class are of the same type. 

\subsection faqitem7 When should I define a copy constructor?
A copy constructor should be defined whenever the object being copied has dynamically allocated memory that must be copied when the object itself is copied. 
This is called a deep copy, which means making a copy of all objects that the object being copied has pointers to. If there is no dynamically allocated memory,
the compiler generated shallow copy will perform correctly. This is true even if the base class of the object has dynamically allocated memory, in this case
the compiler generated constructor will automatically call the correct base class copy constructor. A simple rule to remember is that if there is a destructor,
there should be a copy constructor and assignment operator, as the three work in tandem. If the class has dynamically allocated memory, but a copy constructor would 
not be logical, then a private copy constructor and assignment operator should be defined to prevent a user or the compiler from accidentally calling the incorrect copy 
or assignment operator.

\subsection faqitem8 What is an auto_ptr and how do I use it?
An auto_ptr is a member of the standard library which is used to contain a pointer a dynamically allocated object. The purpose of an auto_ptr is to automatically
handle the deallocation of memory when an object goes out of scope. This allows the use of dynamic memory, which is often advantagous, without having to remember to
deallocate the memory. To use an auto_ptr, you must include the <memory> file. Then declare an auto_ptr as auto_ptr<ObjectType>( new Object ). If you need to declare the auto_ptr
prior to allocation, such as when using it as a member variable, you must use the auto_ptr's reset function to assign the new object to the auto_ptr. If you need to pass the object to
another function, use the get function of the auto_ptr. Do not pass the auto_ptr itself, as only one auto_ptr can have responsibility for an object, so copying an auto_ptr assigns
the memory to the auto_ptr you are copying into. auto_ptrs may not be used inside containers, such as vectors. This may compile, but will cause runtime errors. 

\subsection faqitem9 Why is iosfwd included in header files instead of iostream?
iosfwd is the forward declared version of iostream. iostream is a very large file, and should not be included in a header file unless the class contains a member variable of an iostream type.
Otherwise, always use iosfwd as this will make compilation faster.

\subsection modelques1 How do the simultaneity markets work?
When a NormalMarket is turned into a simultaneity market, the NormalMarket is separated into two markets, a PriceMarket and a DemandMarket. 
Both markets are solved, but only the PriceMarket is accessable from outside the marketplace. Both markets contain a pointer to the other market. 
Calls to PriceMarket::getDemand, PriceMarket::getSupply, PriceMarket::addToDemand, and PriceMarket::addToSupply are redirected to the DemandMarket. 
PriceMarket::setPrice is also a special function, it sets demand equal to the new price and supply equal to the current price. DemandMarket::getDemand
and DemandMarket::addToSupply are also overridden so that DemandMarket::getDemand returns the price and DemandMarket::addToDemand sets the supply
equal to the price. These are the functions used from outside the Marketplace, the Market also contains a set of functions with the word "Raw"
in the name which return or set the true values of the Market::price, Market::supply and Market::demand variables. These are the functions used by the Solver to clear
the markets.
