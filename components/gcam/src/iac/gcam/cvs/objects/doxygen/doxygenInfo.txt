*
* \subsection overview Model Overview
<P>The ObjECTS framework is a flexible, modular, Integrated Assessment modeling framework. The component-based structure of this model represents global energy, land-use, and economic systems through a component hierarchy that aggregates detailed technology information up to a global macroeconomic level.  The primary component hierarchy is from technology -> sub-sector -> sector -> region -> world.  Input is provided by the flexible XML framework, where data is structured in an object hierarchy that parallels that of the model structure.</P> 

The ObjECTS code is intended to replicate both the partial-equilibrium MiniCAM integrated assessment model and a Computable General Equilibrium methodology, similar to that of the current Second Generation Model (SGM).
<P></P> 

The architecture, based on the natural hierarchy of the global economy, is a component structure that consists of the world, region, sector, sub-sector, technology, and emissions objects, as well as a marketplace object that acts as the glue for all the objects.  The architecture incorporates a structure in which the model is driven by data and its availability, so that the specific sectors and technologies used are determined by the input data not the model code.  
<P></P> 
\subsection start Where to Start
There is no main calculation loop in this object structure. For the partial-equilibrium calculation, however, the world::calc() method is the principal calculation method used by the code.
The \ref faq is also a good place to look.

\subsection psd Prices, Supplies and Demands in ObjECTS
The accounting for supply and demand, and the accounting of prices are central to the partial- equilibrium MiniCAM-type calculation in the ObjECTS. <a href="PricesSandD.htm">These Notes</a> are a quick outline of how this process works in the ObjECTS code.
