PTCLM/mydatafiles/README                         11/22/2013

Sample data files directory for PTCLM. PTCLM will create directories
under here as 1x1pt_$SITE where $SITE is the site-code. You need
to put your meteorology data under the 1x1pt_$SITE directory in
a sub-directory called: CLM1PT_data.

The script renamemapfiles is to rename mapping files with the current
creation date, so that PTCLM will not have to remake all of the mapping
files.

For example:

./renamemapfiles -oldate 131122 -newdate 131225
