models/lnd/clm/tools/mkmapgrids/README		Jul/12/2011

The routines in this directory create a grid map dataset in SCRIP format
that can be read by the mkmapdata utility to create mapping files for either
CLM or mksurfdata_map.

The following steps provide a method to create the executable
and generate the grid map dataset:

0) export your input data

1) cd to this directory 

2) run gmake

NOTE: By default code compiles optimized so it's reasonably fast. If you want
      to use the debugger, with bounds-checking, and float trapping on do the 
      following:

   gmake OPT=FALSE

See Also: See the models/lnd/clm/tools/README file for notes about setting
          the path for NetCDF.

3) create namelist file :
   (a sample namelist is: mkmapgrids.namelist)

   make sure the datasets in the namelist correspond to the full path of where
   you downloaded your input datasets.

   Sample namelists (using /fs/cgd/csm as the root location where inputdata was exported) are:

   mkmapgrids.namelist   ----- Standard global dataset at 10x15 resolution


4) run code (e.g.):
        mkmapgrids < mkmapgrids.namelist >&! mksurfdat.out

5) move (and rename if appropriate) generated map grid dataset
   to /fis/cgd/csm/inputdata/lnd/clm/mappingdata/grids, etc.

6) Alturnative to steps 3-5: run the mkmapgrids.csh script to get files for the 
   standard resolutions (already in the namelist_defaults_clm.xml file).

Important files:

  mkmapgrids.csh ------------ Script to run mkmapgrids for many resolutions
  src/Makefile -------------- GNU makefile
  src/Srcfiles -------------- List of source files needed (includes files outside this directory)
  src/Filepath -------------- Filepath location to source files needed
  mkmapgrids.namelist ------- Sample global grid namelist
