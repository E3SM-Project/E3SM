This testmods directory is meant to be used in conjunction with a 20th
century transient case at resolution 1x1_tropicAtl. 

However, it generally should not be used directly. Instead, it should be
extended (i.e., included) by a testmods directory that sets the start date to a
desired year, either just before, in the middle of, or after the starting date
on this file.
