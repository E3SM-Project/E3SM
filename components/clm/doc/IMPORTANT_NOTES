I.) For clm4_0:

Configure Modes NOT scientifically validated, documented, supported or even advised to be used:
(options to CLM_CONFIG_OPTS)

   SNICAR_FRC 	(-snicar_frc)
       This mode is tested and functional, but is NOT constantly scientifcally validated, and should be 
       considered experimental.

Namelist items that should NOT be exercised:

  glc_dyntopo            Change topographic height over glacier MEC (Not functional)
  suplnitro='ALL'        (suplnitro='ALL' with -bgc cn)
                         The suplemental Nitrogen mode of the CN model is known 
                         to be too productive.
  urban_traffic:         Not currently functional

II.) For clm4_5:

Configure Modes NOT scientifically validated, documented, supported or even advised to be used:
(options to CLM_CONFIG_OPTS)

    VIC		      (-vichydro)
        VIC hydrology has just been added, and this mode is experimental.

    EXTRALAKELAYERS   (-exlaklayers)
        Experimental and not normally exercised.

    (-vsoilc_centbgc no-cent,no-nitrif) 
        CLM4.5 BGC is normally exercised with vertical soil carbon, Century pools, and 
        Nitrification/Denitrification with the CLM4Me Methane model. Turning Century pools
        off and/or Nitrification/Denitrification off is experimental and NOT normally exercised.
        We do limited testing with CLM4.5 BGC without vertically resolved Carbon pools.

Namelist items that should NOT be exercised:

    See

    ../bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition_clm4_5.xml -- for definitions

    All of these are experimental, and most are NOT tested, some aren't even functional.
    The two thare ARE tested are: more_vertlayers and allowlakeprod

    allowlakeprod                  Turn methane production on for lake columns
    anoxia_wtsat                   Weight calculation of oxygen limitation by the inundated fraction
                                   if anoxia is on.
                                   (NOT functional -- Deprecated will be removed)
    atm_c14_filename               C14 dataset -- No dataset provided
    exponential_rooting_profile    Use exponential rooting profile.
    fin_use_fsat                   Use the saturated fraction (fsat) calculated 
                                   in Soil Hydrology to diagnose the inundated fraction 
    glc_dyntopo                    Change topographic height over glacier MEC (Not functional)
    lake_decomp_fact               Used if allowlakeprod is on
    more_vertlayers                Increase number of vertical layers
    no_frozen_nitrif_denitrif      No denitrification or nitrification in frozen soil layer
    perchroot                      Weight btran by unfrozen layers
    perchroot_alt                  Weight btran by active layer
    replenishlakec                 Maintain constant soil carbon under lakes
    use_c14_bombspike              Use C14 dataset -- No datasets provided
    usefrootc                      Use the fine root carbon predicted by CN

See KnownBugs/KnownLimitations files for Known Problems:

    See the KnownBugs file in this directory for the list of known problems. We expect
    that eventually we will fix the bugs in this list. In the KnownLimitations file
    we list limitations in the code that we have workarounds for that we do NOT expect
    to fix.
