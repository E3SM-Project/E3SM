made under this Agreement except for additions covered under paragraph

of its Modification in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
Recipients to identify the originator of the Modification.  In
fulfillment of these requirements, Contributor must include a file
(e.g., a change log file) that describes the alterations made and the
date of the alterations, identifies Contributor as originator of the
alterations, and consents to characterization of the alterations as a
Modification, for example, by including a statement that the
Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
Software provided by Government Agency. Once consent is granted, it
may not thereafter be revoked.

Software, a Recipient may not remove it without the express permission
of the Contributor who added the notice.

or a prior Recipient's participation in this Agreement.

Subject Software, each Recipient, upon receipt of the Subject

be Contributor's original creation and does not violate any existing
agreements, regulations, statutes or rules, and further that
Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
Agreement.

warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability obligations to one or

however, only on its own behalf and not on behalf of Government Agency
or any other Recipient.  Such a Recipient must make it absolutely
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity and/or liability
obligation is offered by that Recipient alone.  Further, such
Recipient agrees to indemnify Government Agency and every other
Recipient for any liability incurred by them as a result of warranty,
support, indemnity and/or liability offered by such Recipient.

I.  A Recipient may create a Larger Work by combining Subject Software
with separate software not governed by the terms of this agreement and
distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such case, the
Recipient must make sure Subject Software, or portions thereof,
included in the Larger Work is subject to this Agreement.

J.  Notwithstanding any provisions contained herein, Recipient is
hereby put on notice that export of any goods or technical data from
the United States may require some form of export license from the
U.S. Government.  Failure to obtain necessary export licenses may
result in criminal liability under U.S. laws.  Government Agency
