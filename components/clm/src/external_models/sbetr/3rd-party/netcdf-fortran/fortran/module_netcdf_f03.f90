Module netcdf_f03

!> Module to provide inheritance of data and interfaces from nf_data and
!! nf_interfaces modules. Not really needed by netCDF but provided for
!! folks writing new code or updating old code who would prefer using
!! modules instead of the old netcdf.inc include file.

!! Version 2.0 - April 2009 - Added netcdf4 interfaces

!! This module can be used as a replacement for an include to netcdf.inc
!! The module is named netcdf_f03 to avoid a conflict with the netcdf
!! module generated by the Fortran 90 interfaces

 USE netcdf_nf_data        ! Brings in the nf interface error flags etc.
 USE netcdf_nf_interfaces  ! Brings in explicit interfaces to nf_ routines

 Implicit NONE
