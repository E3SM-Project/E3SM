One-line Summary:

Purpose of changes:

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by:

List all subroutines eliminated:

List all subroutines added and what they do:

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the
appropriate machine below.  All failed tests must be justified.

yellowstone/intel:

goldbach/nag:

goldbach/pgi or jaguar/pgi:

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
- what platforms/compilers:
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate):

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
- MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:

URL for AMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:
