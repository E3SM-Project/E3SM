One-line Summary: Improve performance of satellite history output
 and bug fix in modal aerosol surface area routine

Purpose of changes:

 - It has been observed that CAM's run-time performance is degraded
   when satellite history output is turned on, especially when running
   on higher resolution grids.  The sat_hist_write method was spending
   the bulk of its time doing a "find nearest neighbor" operation to
   determine the nearest column(s) to output.  Each PE was searching the
   entire global grid (both dynamics grid and physics grid). Modifications
   here parallelizes the find nearest neighbor operation and performance
   is greatly improved.

 - Fix a bug in modal aerosol surface area routine used for heterogeneous
   chemistry reactions.

 - Build-namelist use case changes to be consistent with 1.2.2 release.

One-line Summary: Fix broken COSP, namelist defaults, ideal physics, PGI on hopper, micro_mg_cam

Purpose of changes:

- COSP had include files with .f instead of .inc.  Use the new COSP external to allow CESM to compile it
 
- CAM standalone whn running SE ne16np4 was broken - updated namelist defaults to fix problem

- ideal physics with threading was broken.  Eliminated ptend as a thread private variable and made
  it an array with a chunk index

- Fixed PGI compilation on hopper

One-line Summary: Namelist control for AMWG variability
 diagnostics; remove rad_diag_1 from CAM5/RCP use cases; add new
 history_amwg defaults.

Purpose of changes:

. Add a namelist variable, history_vdiag, which adds the specific fields at
  daily, 6-hourly, and 3-hourly output frequency required by the AMWG
  variability diagnostics.  Setting history_vdiag=.true. in the namelist is
  the only action required on the user's part, unless there is a conflict
  with the setting of nhtfrq.  The history_vdiag option writes fields to
  auxilliary history files h1, h2, and h3, and it assumes that the output
  frequency for these files is set to daily, 6-hourly, and 3-hourly
  respectively.  If the value of nhtfrq is set by the user, the first 4
  elements must be 0,-24,-6,-3.  Otherwise build-namelist will flag an
  error.  In the case of an error be sure to check whether the use case is
  the source of the inconsistent values of nhtfrq.

. All CAM5/RCP use case files have been modified to remove the diagnostic
  radiation calculation.  This is an expensive diagnostic and it was
  decided that it should not be enabled by default.

. Add variables TAUGWX, TAUGWY, TAUTMSX, TAUTMSY to the history_amwg field
  list.

One-line Summary: Subcolumn prep for MG, update frankfurt to goldbach

Purpose of changes:

- Size distribution calculations for the radiation and diagnostic output
  are now done in micro_mg_cam, instead of directly using the outputs from
  micro_mg_tend. This will allow them to be done after all subcolumn and
  substepping averages, which presents a more consistent state for RRTMG.

- Add new test to check that svn:mergeinfo exists in the root directory of
  CAM, and nowhere else.

- Transition from frankfurt to goldbach as a test system.

        - Have micro_mg_cam initialize micro_mg_utils for MG 1 (in future
          versions, the portable layer of MG will do this).
        - Define mincld in micro_mg_utils. In future versions, this will
          allow micro_mg_cam and the portable layer to share this value.
          For now, only micro_mg_cam uses it.
        - Do size distribution parameter calculations for the radiation
          in micro_mg_cam, rather than using the MG outputs. Reorder some
          output statements for consistency with this.

One-line Summary: Improve stability of the ZM scheme.

Purpose of changes:

- In the ZM deep convection scheme, use Brent's method to invert the
  entropy equation, as it converges faster.

- In the ZM scheme, for the mixing ratio of water vapor at saturation, use
  a ratio over total mass rather than over dry mass, to avoid numerical
  overflow that can occur at high temperature.

- Limit RRTMG so that it only operates below 1 Pa, rather than using the
  lid of 0.01 Pa that was in place before. (Only impacts WACCM5 and other
  high-top RRTMG runs.)

- Prevent rare divide by zero error for very cold grid points in
  modal_aero_wateruptake.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

        - Work around divide-by-zero error by checking for water vapor
          saturation pressures that are 0. (If this happens, the saturation
          pressure is wrong anyway because the temperature is unrealistic,
          but we give the model the chance to recover, or to throw a better
          error elsewhere.)

One-line Summary: changes to defaults for soil_erod and dust_emis_fact

Purpose of changes:

A problem with too low dust burdens in high res (1/2 and 1/4 deg) cam5 runs
was traced to the soil_erod datasets being used at those resolutions.  The
proposed solution involves using the 2 deg (1.9x2.5) dataset at all
resolutions higher than 2 deg.  Since we have already tuned the 1 deg FV
runs using the 0.9x1.25 dataset, an exception will be made for that case to
maintain backwards compatibility.  There are also several low resolution
specific versions of soil_erod that will be maintained for backwards
compatibility (and because there is no known problem with them).

It is unnecessary to produce specific high resolution version of soil_erod by
interpolating the 1.9x2.5 dataset since CAM is already set up to do this on
the fly internally (this was done to support the SE dycore and not require
resolution specific datasets for all the SE grids).  Therefore the fix is
to simply modify the build-namelist defaults so that the 1.9x2.5 dataset is
used for all dycores at all resolutions except the 1 deg FV case, and for
the existing low res specific datasets.

There is also a change to the dust_emis_fact tuning parameter.  Po-Lun Ma
has done simulations showing that the dust burdens for the 1/2 and 1/4 deg
FV case is improved by using the value 0.45 (the value from the tuning with
the 1 deg soil_erod dataset is set to 0.35).  This change has been included
as well.

The SE setting for dust_emis_fact has not been changed from the value of
0.55 which was from tuning ne30np4 using the 1 deg soil_erod dataset.
Since the tuning of CAM-SE is ongoing we decided to change all the SE
resolutions to use the 1.9x2.5 soil erod dataset recognizing that
dust_emis_fact will need retuning for SE.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:


     NOTE: There are changes for porting to the NAG compiler, as well as
           cosmetic changes (such as whitespace), throughout the CARMA
           modules. The most common such change is to wrap lines that would
           otherwise be longer than the Fortran standard's limit (132
           characters.) These changes will not be listed individually.


M       models/atm/cam/SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
         - New CARMA external.

M       models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
M       models/atm/cam/bld/config_files/definition.xml
M       models/atm/cam/bld/configure
M       models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
M       models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
         - Add settings for new CARMA models and features.
         - Allow the user to increase the maximum allowed number of
           radiatively active (or diagnosed) constituents, using the new
           option "-max_n_rad_cnst".

M       models/atm/cam/bld/perl5lib/Build/Namelist.pm
M       models/atm/cam/bld/perl5lib/Build/NamelistDefinition.pm
         - Allow namelist_definitions.xml to specify a variable as an array
           dimension (for n_rad_cnst).

M       models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
         - For NAG, don't expand macros in comments (workaround for fpp
           regression).

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg_cam.F90
         - Don't add rel_fn to the physics buffer, since it's only used for
           output from MG itself.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_prop.F90
         - Remove limit on maximum number of unique input files, by using
           an allocatable to store the list.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physics_types.F90
         - Allow grid cells to have negative altitude. (Fixes issue with
           state_debug_checks and negative topology.)

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/rad_constituents.F90
         - Maximum number of radiative constituents now comes from the
           parameter n_rad_cnst, set from the macro N_RAD_CNST.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radiation_data.F90
         - Don't output rel_fn; it can be output by MG, and is not actually
           an input the radiation uses in the first place.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/cam/carma_getT.F90
         - Spelling correction.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/cam/carma_intr.F90
         - Create and use new H2O/H2SO4 profiles.
         - Correct indexing errors.
         - Changes for new fractal code.
         - Fix fairly severe error where "nf90_get_var" was being used
           instead of "nf90_put_var", leading to outputs of files
           containing uninitialized data.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/models/cirrus/carma_model_mod.F90
         - Fix bug where state was being inappropriately modified by calls
           to MG routines.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/models/sea_salt/carma_model_mod.F90
         - Address case where Weibull_k is 0 differently.
         - Removed prescribed Weibull coefficients entirely from this file,
           since this feature has not been completed, and the incomplete
           pieces broke the NAG build.

         - Removed unnecessary use of ssi_ref.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radiation.F90

           never used.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/TER.sh
         - For restart tests, copy RRTMG optical property files that have

         - Change SD-WACCM CARMA sulfate test to a debug mode test.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/input_tests_master
         - Add tests for CAM4+RRTMG and new CARMA models.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/nl_files/outfrq3s_carma
         - Remove year specification (it messed up the SD test, which

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/test_driver.sh
         - Explicitly use netCDF 4.3 on Frankfurt/NAG, since the symlink

One-line Summary: Update yellowstone intel compiler to 13.1.2 to allow implementation of eq tests for CESM

Purpose of changes:
  - Have CAM standalone tests on yellowstone use Intel 13.1.2 to allow CESM eq tests to be BFB (compiler version
      CESM is currently using)
  - Modified CESM regression tests on yellowstone to be eq tests for CAM4 FV and CAM5 SE
  - Added missing finidat file for ne30np4 case (answers were not BFB with CESM without it)
  - Updated to alpha06d externals (except CLM which has a bug) to eliminate core dump in pio
  - Performed mergeinfo cleanup (svn propdel svn:mergeinfo -R; svn revert .)

********* SPECIAL NOTES ON TESTING **************
** Due to time constraints due to the upcoming holidays,
** yellowstone tests were run without changes to inidat.
** The change to inidat allowed sm374 and sm430 to run to
** completion and these two group of tests were rerun.  
** Other yellowstone tests were not run with this inidat 
** change on yellowstone.

One-line Summary: update SE dycore tuning parameters and mct_libdir option

Purpose of changes:

. Update SE dycore tuning parameters
  - Change time stepping method to RK5 (Kinnmark & Gray Runga-Kutta 5
    stage; 3rd order accurate in time)
  - Set the namelists variables as recommended for RK5 in:
    http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/pel/software/cam-se-dt-table.pdf
  - Add "tstep_type" namelist option for SE dycore
  - Turn on the FV energy fixer (This will be updated later on with
    Williamson an Olson enery fixer)
  - Remove the variable "energy_fixer" from the cam namelist.
 
  To update a namelist created by an earlier CAM tag for an SE run on
  grid ne30np4 one should make the following changes:
  - The default settings for CESM1.2.0 were:
    tstep_type =1
    hypervis_subcycle = 2
    qsplit =4
    rsplit = 5
    se_ftype =1
    se_nsplit = 1
 
  - The new recommended settings are:
    tstep_type =5
    hypervis_subcycle = 3
    qsplit = 1
    rsplit = 3
    se_ftype =0
    se_nsplit = 2

  These changes have been approved by the AMWG co-chairs:
  Rich Neale: 11/11/2013
  Minghua Zhang: 11/12/2013
  Mark Taylor: 11/12/2013

. Allow the CAM standalone mode to build the MCT libs outside the CAM build
  directory so that they can be reused for multiple CAM builds.  The
  location of the MCT build is specified using the -mct_libdir argument.
  If the libraries are present in the location specified by -mct_libdir
  then the MCT configure and build do not need to be redone.

One-line Summary: Compiler fixes, prep work for new MG substepping.

Purpose of changes:

 - Bring in changes from the MG microphysics development branch, to make it
   easier to merge the full set of changes with the new subcolumn framework
   later.

   This includes micro_mg_utils, which provides routines that implement
   part of the core functionality of MG version 2 (coming soon).

 - Fix issues identified by NAG.

 - Fix issue due to missing CMELIQ output in the CLUBB interface.

 - Address other bugs that show up in rare cases.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

 - #1813: CMELIQ no longer able to be output

        - Module providing utility code and individual process subroutines.
          Part of MG 2.0 will be based on this module.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

M       SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
        - Update csm_share to a version where gamma is an elemental
          function.

M       models/atm/cam/bld/cam.buildnml.csh
        - Turn on state_debug_checks if DEBUG is TRUE.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/apex_subs.F90
        - Send array sections to TRILIN rather than individual elements
          (i.e. pointers), to satisfy NAG checks that error due to the
          dummy array exceeding the bounds of the actual argument array.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/spedata.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/metdata.F90
        - Nullify pointers and take steps to reduce the chance of an
          uninitialized pointer reference.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/utils/modal_aero_wateruptake.F90
        - Change modal_aero_kohler to use assumed shape arrays to avoid a
          pointless copy.

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/interpolate_data.F90
        - Use new integer flag in lininterp_full1d instead of a literal 1.
        - Remove inappropriate check that causes failure in RRTMG for
          serial cases that are not SCAM runs.

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/wrap_nf.F90
        - Remove arbitrary addition of "1" to a dimension; this has no
          clear purpose and was causing issues for CARMA with strict
          compiler checks.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/clubb_intr.F90
        - Add missing addfld/outfld calls for CMELIQ.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg1_0.F90
        - Remove unnecessary output "cldo".
        - Rearrange statements.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg_cam.F90
        - Reduce the number of differences with respect to the MG 2.0
          development branch, including statement reordering, cleanup,
          whitespace, and output changes.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/tropopause.F90
        - Switch to assumed-shape arrays for twmo interface, avoiding an
          unnecessary copy, and also change the name "gamma" to "gam" to
          avoid any name clash with the F2008 intrinsic.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/models/cirrus/carma_model_mod.F90
        - Remove routines that were duplicated from an earlier version of
          the MG microphysics, and instead use versions from the new
          micro_mg_utils module.

One-line Summary: Refactor the chemistry-aerosol model interface and update drv tag.

Purpose of changes:

 - The chemistry-aerosol model interface was refactored to provide a more
   extendable framework.  This will ease incorporation of other aerosol
   models (e.g., a sectional aerosol model)

  This refactoring of the chemistry-aerosol model interface does away with the numerous
  ifdefs that have been historically used to embed aerosol models within CAM-Chem.
  Each aerosol model must provide the following modules in chemistry/name_aero (where
  name is a named aerosol model, e.g., modal):
    aero_model.F90 ------- aerosol model specific module with methods:
      . aero_model_drydep ----- aerosol dry deposition and sediment
      . aero_model_wetdep ----- aerosol wet removal
      . aero_model_emissions -- aerosol emissions
      . aero_model_surfarea --- aerosol surface area for chemistry
      . aero_model_gasaerexch - create, grow, change, and shrink aerosols
    dust_model.F90 ------- dust module with methods
      . dust_names - dust species names
      . dust_nbin -- number of dust bins
      . dust_emis -- emissions method
    seasalt_model.F90 ---- sea salt module with methods
      . seasalt_names - sea salt species names
      . seasalt_nbin -- number of sea salt bins
      . seasalt_emis -- sea salt emissions method
    sox_cldaero_mod.F90 -- aerosol model specific code for cloud aerosol/SOx aqueous chemistry

 - Update drv tag to drvseq5_0_03 which fixes SCAM test

One-line Summary: Minor corrections to aerosol code and bug fixes

Purpose of changes:

This branch isolates the answer changing corrections uncovered
during the refactoring of chemistry/aerosol interface.

Answer changing features:

 - Corrections to dust emissions to use unmodified dust fluxes
   from the coupler each time step -- in time-steps where fluxes
   from surface models were not updated modification of cam_in%cflx
   were not representations of dust flux from surface models but the
   modification of dust fluxes from the previous time-step.  For example,
   when the model advances from time step 0 to time step 1 it does not
   couple with surface models and thus does not restore cflx with dust
   fluxes from coupler.

 - Removed kludge in ChemNamelist.pm that excluded H2SO4 from the
   gas_wetdep_list namelist variable

 - Register number density tracers with qmin of 1e-5 -- this allows
   removal of special code  in uwshcu for MAM

 - Scale organic aerosol emissions off line for MAM

 - Replace obsolete sulfchem routine with some chemistry for trop_bam

 - Let chemistry output all aerosols in MMR units (kg/kg)
   and gas species in VMR units (mole/mole) regardless of
   aerosol model

 - Corrections in setsox routine for chemistry mechanisms with MAM3
   aerosols that include NH3

 - Removed kludge in the hetrxtrate routine of mo_usrrxt which was
   introduced to keep the bulk aerosol model bit-for-bit

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): Bug 1824

Date: 2013/09/22
One-line Summary: Fix radiation bug, change SE dycore to run with Pa.

Purpose of changes:

 - Fix a bug in cloud_rad_props, which was rounding down in a table lookup
rather than interpolating between table values, due to declaring an integer
rather than a real as the interpolation weight.

 - Change the dycore to use units of Pa instead of hPa, to remove the need
for a conversion and prevent future bugs.

 - Fix minor precision issues, where complex numbers were constructed in
single precision when double was intended.

 - Add clarification to error message in modal_aer_opt.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

#1794 - Interpolation in cloud_rad_props is less precise than originally
        intended.
#1797 - CMPLX has wrong precision in several places

M       models/atm/cam/SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
         - Update HOMME external to use Pa instead of hPa.

M       models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
         - Clarify that do_circulation_diags must be set to .true. for QBO
           forcing to work in WACCM.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/utils/modal_aero_wateruptake.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_prop.F90
         - Add explicit kind to calls of the intrinsic "cmplx", to ensure
           that it returns a complex number with double-precision
           components.

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/interpolate_data.F90
         - Add parameters corresponding to the extrap_method values, so
           that callers can use named constants rather than bare ints.

M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/se/dp_coupling.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/se/dyn_comp.F90

M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/se/inidat.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/se/stepon.F90
         - Remove conversions to hPa (factors of 100._r8).

M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/se/spmd_dyn.F90
         - Remove unnecessary use statement.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg1_0.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg1_5.F90
         - Very slightly reduce the max value of lambda_c so that it will
           always fall within the limits of the table in RRTMG.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/modal_aer_opt.F90
         - Clarify error message for unreasonable optical depth, and abort
           when optical depth is negative.
         - Make calls to cmplx return double precision values.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/cloud_rad_props.F90
         - Use lininterp to do interpolation of lookup tables, instead of
           using (buggy) custom code.

If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,

  CAM-5 changes answers due to bug fixes, CAM-SE due to units change. This
accounts for all failed baselines.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:

  All CAM-SE cases, and all CAM5 (specifically due to RRTMG, MG, and MAM
  changes).

- what platforms/compilers:

  All.

- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

  The pressure unit change and the cmplx changes are at or below single
  precision roundoff. RRTMG is larger than roundoff and climate changing.

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):

One-line Summary: minor microphysics rearrangement and cleanup

Purpose of changes:
- Moved calculation of in-cloud water values for radiation into cloud_diagnostics
- Moved calls for micro_mg_tend back to inline instead of being contained at end of module
- Simplified the calling list for conv_water_4rad
- Moved a handful pbuf_add_field, outfld and addfld calls to modules where data is being set
- Renamed pbuf_times to dyn_time_lvls and itim to itim_old.  These values should only be
  used for leap-frogging times. 
- cmeliq is now a member of pbuf and not passed on calling lists
- Removed effi, effc, effc_fn, effliq, effice and effliq_fn variables as they were exact copies
  of rei, rel and rel_fn and were redundant inside micro_mg_cam.F90

One-line Summary: Fix NAG, CESM scripts with Frankfurt/PGI, serial CAM-SE

Purpose of changes:

 - Fix the NAG port, since the RRTMG changes were temporarily reverted to
   fix a bug on big-endian systems (e.g. Mira).

 - Pull in an updated Machines tag so that the CESM scripts can run with
   PGI on Frankfurt.

 - Have CAM tests use PGI 13.7 on Frankfurt, and change compiler flags, to
   match the new Machines tag.

 - Fix HOMME when SPMD is not defined, so that it will work with
   mpi-serial.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

 - The "-Mvect=nosse" option is no longer used for PGI, because SSE
   vectorization has been safe for a while now, and because Machines has
   made the same change.

         - Add "implicit none" to pmgrid, since "iam" and "masterproc"
           were getting implicit types.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/TCB_ccsm.sh

One-line Summary: Gravity wave refactoring, remove WACCM_PHYS CPP macro.

Purpose of changes:

 - Remove WACCM_PHYS CPP macro (and the equivalent "do_waccm_phys"
   function) in favor of more specific physics options.

 - Merge CAM and WACCM gravity wave modules and split the result into
   smaller, mostly portable modules.

 - Make WACCM modules read their own namelists.

 - Move uzm and frontgf/frontga from physics_state to the physics buffer,
   since they are not treated the same as other physics_state variables and
   introduce unnecessary complication into physics_types.

 - Remove Lahey support, since new code in this tag uses Fortran 2003
   features.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

 - Due to a unit mismatch between CAM and HOMME, WACCM-SE was using a
   frontogenesis function that was ~14x too large.

 - Fix some namelist values in 1850_cam5_pm.xml that had yellowstone paths
   hard-coded (h/t Chris Fischer).

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

 - New history_waccm flag, for turning on common outputs for WACCM runs.
   Implementation of this flag is incomplete and should be considered a
   work in progress.

 - Three new namelist variables, use_gw_oro, use_gw_front, and
   use_gw_convect, are provided to turn on the three types of gravity wave
   sources currently used in CAM and WACCM.

 - Several previously hard-coded parameters were added to gw_drag_nl.

 - New namelist variables "do_molec_press" and "molec_diff_bot_press"
   determine whether molecular diffusion is on, and the bottom level where
   it will take place, respectively.

 - Existing namelist variables have been moved from cam_inparm to qbo_nl,
   radheat_nl, and iondrag_nl.

 - New namelist settings for WACCM-SE with vertically Lagrangian advection.

         - Stub version of QBO module.

A       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/vdiff_lu_solver.F90
         - Contains vd_lu_decomp and vd_lu_solve, so this code can be
           shared rather than duplicated between diffusion_solver and
           gw_drag. These are also modified so that the output of
           vd_lu_decomp is contained in an object of type "lu_decomp",
           which can then be fed back to vd_lu_solver directly.

         - Add history_waccm namelist option.
         - Add new molecular diffusion pressures to namelist.
         - Add new gw_drag namelist variables.
         - Move namelist variables out of cam_inparm.

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/runtime_opts.F90
         - Have qbo, radheat, and iondrag read their own namelists.
         - Call waccm_forcing_readnl from within radheat_readnl.

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/sat_hist.F90

         - Set WACCM variables in the physics buffer rather than
           physics_state.
         - Replace "do_waccm_phys" with flags specific to the qbo and
           gw_drag modules.
         - Sometimes frontgf was handled before frontga, and sometimes vice
           versa. This made it too easy to mix them up, so move frontgf
           before frontga in all these cases.
         - Fix bug where WACCM-SE was using a too-large frontogenesis
           function.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/convect_deep.F90

           field.
         - Change name of "ZMDT" to "TTEND_DP" in the physics buffer.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/diffusion_solver.F90
         - Pull LU solver routines out into the portable module named
           vdiff_lu_solver. This is the only dependency of
           diffusion_solver, so it is effectively portable in that sense.
           Portability is still limited by the fact that it must be passed
           routines with very specific interfaces for molecular diffusion.
         - Update interfaces for compute_molec_diff and the vd_lu_*
           routines.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/iondrag.F90
         - Harmonize stub module with WACCM version and make calls to its
           routines non-fatal (so we don't need WACCM_PHYS to determine
           whether or not to call it).

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/molec_diff.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/ref_pres.F90
         - Have ref_pres find molecular diffusion levels, rather than
           molec_diff.
         - Change the way ref_pres calculates levels, to guarantee that a
           "top" level is not too high and a "bottom" level is not too low.
         - Return information about the interpretation of kvt from
           compute_molec_diff, so that diffusion_solver no longer has to
           use "waccmx_is".
         - Use the new lu_decomp type for compatibility with
           vdiff_lu_solver.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_control.F90
         - Add WACCM history flag.
         - Add use_gw_* flags to specify which gravity wave sources are on.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physics_types.F90
         - Remove uzm, frontgf, and frontga from physics_state objects.
         - Allow ZM to use a different name from convect_deep.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physpkg.F90
         - Since exbdrift is only used directly by iondrag, move the call
           to exbdrift_register into iondrag as well.
         - Change gw_drag interfaces.
         - Remove "#ifdef WACCM_PHYS" statements.
         - Pass pbuf to qbo_relax, since UZM is now in pbuf.
         - Call WACCM physics routines in the same order throughout.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radheat.F90
         - Add stub namelist read to replace defaultopts and setopts.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/vertical_diffusion.F90
         - Don't advertise gravity wave drag as "coming soon" in the
           comments.
         - Use a utility function in ref_pres to set ntop_eddy.
         - Use history_waccm to switch on add_default calls.
         - Account for changes in molec_diff and diffusion_solver
           interfaces.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/zm_conv_intr.F90
         - Change ptend%name from "convect_deep" to "zm_conv_tend".

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/iondrag.F90
         - Have iondrag handle its own namelist.
         - Move in register logic from physpkg.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/qbo.F90
         - Have qbo handle its own namelist.
         - Get uzm from physics buffer.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/radheat.F90
         - Have radheat handle its own namelist.
         - radheat calls waccm_forcing_readnl.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/waccm_forcing.F90
         - Change null filename (no effect, done just to be consistent with
           QBO).

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccmx/majorsp_diffusion.F90
         - Get molecular diffusion levels from ref_pres, not molec_diff.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physics_buffer.F90.in
         - Fix spelling error.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/input_tests_master
         - Add tests for WACCM-SE and tests that exercise the
           waccm_sc_2000_cam4 use_case.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/CAM_compare.sh
         - Fix bug where fields with small differences would not be printed
           to the log after a comparison failure.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/TCB_ccsm.sh
         - Allow compiler names to be specified as part of machine names
           (e.g. "frankfurt_nag").
         - Turn repetitive blocks into loops.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/input_tests_master

           CAM_BATCHQ="short" will work.
         - Remove Lahey section.

A       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/gw_utils.F90

Highlights of the refactoring:

    - Merge WACCM and CAM modules.

    - Use history_waccm to switch on add_default calls.

    - Eliminate dead code, including an old spectral wave source from CAM's
      version of gw_drag and a buggy implementation of low level stress
      divergence.

    - Set previously hard-coded parameters via namelist.

    - Change names of gw_inti and gw_intr to gw_init and gw_tend.

    - Move the gravity wave source routines into separate modules
      (gw_convect, gw_front, and gw_oro), which are turned on or off via
      the phys_control namelist.

    - Homogenize and simplify code for the three gravity wave sources,
      to simplify the process of adding new sources in the future.

    - Separate addfld/outfld calls from other code, and move gravity
      wave drag profile routines into a portable layer (gw_common).

    - Separate diffusion routines into a separate module from
      gw_common, called gw_diffusion, using the new vdiff_lu_solver
      module to share code with diffusion_solver.

    - Create a module for common vector operations (gw_utils).

    - Fix UTGWORO, VTGWORO, and TTGWORO to more accurately reflect the
      wind and temperature tendencies from orographic gravity waves.

    - Use cpairv rather than cpair (for consistency in WACCM-X).

    - Reorder loops to access memory in order and contiguously, and
      only calculate the LU decomposition once for diffusion due to
      gravity wave breaking, as diffusion_solver already does. These
      two optimizations reduce the total cost of spectral gravity
      waves by >40% (Yellowstone/ifort). Most of this gain is due to
      loop reordering, but it's unclear how much of the benefit was
      due to vectorization vs. more efficient cache use. In loops where the
      level bounds varied by column for the Beres scheme, this was handled
      mostly by masking assignments (where statements).

    - Change most arrays from size pcols to size ncol. This cleans up
      the code slightly because array operations no longer need an
      explicit bound (e.g. "src_level(:ncol)"), but there was no
      significant effect on computation time.

    - Purely orographic waves have taken a performance hit (roughly double
      the cost), but still only represent about 0.1% of the total cost of
      CAM5. This cost seems to be primarily the result of changes to
      gw_drag_prof, which needs more per-column level indices for the Beres
      scheme.

    - Miscellaneous cleanup, e.g. limiting lines to <=80 characters, and
      re-ordering arguments in interfaces.

The bl314 tests failed because the old files used for WACCM at 10x15 have a
different vertical grid, and so some pressure limiters are now rounded to
a different level due to changes in ref_pres. This has no impact on current
WACCM cases.

The CESM tests on Frankfurt failed because of machine issues that have
temporarily broken the CESM port.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations: WACCM
- what platforms/compilers: All
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

  - For WACCM-FV, larger than roundoff changes for diagnostic output only
    (UTGWORO and VTGWORO). The climate and all other diagnostics should be
    bit-for-bit.

  - For WACCM-SE, a climate-changing bug fix for the frontogenesis
    function.

  - Some old WACCM files, such as the default for 10x15 resolution, use
    different pressure levels than more current files. The tropospheric
    cloud physics top level was changed for these cases due to the change
    in ref_pres. This showed up in SC-WACCM testing but does not affect
    current, supported WACCM cases, as demonstrated by a test of SC-WACCM
    on FV at a resolution of 4x5 degrees.

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,

One-line Summary: COSP build fix for CESM, CLUBB threading fix,
                  namelist updates

Purpose of changes:
.  The COSP build was broken when using cesm scripts with the latest
   cesm tags.  This is now fixed.

.  CLUBB was giving different answers when the number of threads are
   changed.  This is mostly fixed, except for when clubb_history is true.
   When clubb_history is true and the number of threads is > 1, then 
   build-namelist exits with an error message.

.  Namelist updates for flbc_file and bndtvs.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:
. configure was refactored so cesm scripts build COSP in a separate library
  the same way cam stand alone does.  cosp_libdir is a new option for configure,
  this is the directory the COSP library will be built.

One-line Summary: Answer-changing fixes and cleanup, NAG port fixes

Purpose of changes:

 Fix a bug that caused cases with interactive chemistry involving the CLY
 and BRY families to crash within a few years.

 Fix a race condition when using WACCM-SE with threading.

 Collect answer-changing code cleanup in one tag:

  - Remove references to "nonintrinsic" functions, which were
    provided only to preserve answers during the NAG port. Unit
    tests have verified that nonintrinsic and intrinsic versions
    of these functions match to within roundoff error in most cases
    (the exceptions involve large arguments to the gamma function,
    which are not needed by CAM, or gfortran, which has a less
    accurate library).

  - Remove a switch in pkg_cldoptics that caused a pointless
    difference between WACCM and CAM cases (the do_waccm_phys switch
    and the WACCM_PHYS macro will likely be removed entirely soon).

  - Change hard-coded physical constants in chemistry to use
    physconst (directly, or through mo_constants).

  - Remove dead code and change r4 to r8 in modal_aero_coag.

 Fix regressions with the NAG port and get it working out of the box.

 More bug fixes from various sources:
  - Fix broken Darwin build (from Chuck Bardeen).
  - Fix multi-instance CAM-SE (from Jim Edwards).
  - Fix for topo_tool (from Peter Lauritzen).
  - Correct physics_buffer abort messages (from Steve Goldhaber).

 Update externals to make the above possible:

  - csm_share: Fix for shr_spfn_gamma on Intel.
  - CLM: NAG port tag.
  - MCT: Fixes for NAG port, Darwin build, and Intel bounds-checking.
         These fixes have not been put into a released version of MCT
         yet, so for now CAM is using an MCT branch as its external.

 Some externals updated to try to avoid CLM compatibility issues:

  - RTM
  - scripts
  - Machines

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

 - 1729: WACCM (and possibly strat chem) crashes within a few years
 - 1744: WACCM-SE sometimes fails due to race condition with threading

These were expected to have answer changes due to the change in
pkg_cldoptics.F90. However, this change would only affect CAM3 and CAM4
non-WACCM cases, and only if temperatures fell below 180K. The most likely
explanation for the fact that these baseline tests passed, is that
temperatures never fell below 180K during the test.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:

  All cases with CAM3/4 physics that are not WACCM cases, all cases with
  CAM5 physics, and all cases with active chemistry. The CARMA cirrus,
  dust, and sea_salt models are also affected.

  Therefore, the only bit-for-bit cases will be those without typical CAM
  physics (e.g. using ideal physics) and WACCM4 specified chemistry cases.

- what platforms/compilers:

  All.

- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

  Larger than roundoff but same climate, except that changes to use
  statements for shr_spfn_mod may be roundoff-level for most compilers.

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

  For shr_spfn_mod changes, this was demonstrated during previous unit
  tests of csm_share code.

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
- MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:

URL for AMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:

List all subroutines added and what they do:
M       models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_history.F90
.  get_field_properties: Retrieve properties from CAM history field
     This function needed to provide information to non-history code
     needing to manipulate history data (e.g., subcol_outfld).

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_history_support.F90
.  check_hist_coord interface consisting of routines to verify
     consistency between data passed in an add_hist_coord or
     add_vert_coord call and any data already residing in
     hist_coords. This interface includes subroutines for each datatype
     found in the hist_coord_t derived type.
.  add_hist_coord interface consisting of the following two routines
.  add_hist_coord_int: New routine for registering mdim and storing all
     information relevant to an mdim when the dimension values are integral
.  add_hist_coord_r8: New routine for registering mdim and storing all
     information relevant to an mdim when the dimension values are real
.  add_vert_coord: Routine for adding the vertical mdims (lev and ilev).
.  write_hist_coord_att: Write the NetCDF attributes for a single hist coord
.  write_hist_coord_atts: Write the NetCDF attributes for all hist coords
.  write_hist_coord_var: Write the NetCDF data for a single hist coord

M       models/atm/cam/src/utils/grid_flag_utils.F90
. Utilities to support grid flags
    col_type - number from 0-31 - used to identify which type of field (currently: 0=grid, 1=sub-col)
    grid_type - integer(bit_field_kind) which contains the appropriate fields turned on/off (internally each bit of
                a grid_type flag indicates on/off status for each type of field)

    * clear_grid_types - clears all the flags from provided grid_types_flag
    * is_col_type_set - returns true if requested col_type flag is set in provided grid_types_flag
    * set_col_type - returns a grid_types integer with the requested col_type flag set
    * add_col_type - adds the requested col_type to the provided grid_types_flag
    * clear_col_type - clears the requested col_type fromthe provided grid_types_flag

One-line Summary: Merge updates from cesm1_2_0 release branches 

Purpose of changes:

. Merge updates from the release branch to match cesm1_2_0_n05_cam5_3_01.
  Excluding the offline radiation driver.

. Improve how CAM standalone build handles NetCDF.  Improved error handling
  for configure's use of the nf-config and nc-config scripts to determine
  the link arguments.  Also made mods to allow the user to *not* specify
  NetCDF include file or library locations.  This is useful for working
  with compiler wrapper scripts that already have this information from the
  system module settings (e.g., when using the mpif90 wrapper script on
  yellowstone).

. Swapped test 735 on frankfurt with 991 on yellowstone.  Did this because
  The TEQ_ccsm 991 test was failing due to different intel compiler versions
  being used for cam stand alone, and cesm scripts.  735 was swapped because
  it's run lenght was about the same as 991.  In order to do this, the pes
  layout for frankfurt had to be overridden in TCB_ccsm.sh, and CCSM_MACH
  had to be set for frankfurt.

. Other testing changes were turning on debugging for the WACCM-X post-tag
  test on yellowstone, and add support for testing on edison.

. Updates for testing and run script example for yellowstone to set OMP_STACKSIZE and remove
  INC_NETCDF and LIB_NETCDF.

. Fix units for aerosol, basically it is all variables with the name that contain "num".  Units
  were "kg/m2/s", should be " 1/m2/s"

. #NO_MPI2 logic was removed, and MPI2 code was removed.  The MPI2 all_gather calls were failing due
  to a bug in MPI2.  

. SVN externals updated to match cesm1_2_beta08

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. OMP bug fixed for WACCM-X.

. Memory leak fix for WACCM-SE.

M       models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. Update how configure deals with the NetCDF library.
  - Remove the default locations of /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib.
    The compiler wrapper scripts that are used on yellowstone supply this
    information, so there's no reason for configure to supply a default
    that's almost never correct.
  - Remove the check that the netCDF header files and libraries exist.  We
    may not know where they are.
  - Don't fail if .mod files not found
  - If the netcdf lib path is specified, then attempt to get netcdf link
    args from the nf-config or nc-config scripts.  But if that fails then
    set defaults based on the specified library path.
  - Add a -rpath setting to the link args unless the nf-config or nc-config
    scripts have already set info to be passed to linker (assuming the user
    has provided netcdf lib path)
  - Fix bug in test code (the create mode needed to be defined).

One-line Summary: Fixes for CAM-CHEM, WACCM, and CARMA issues (posttag tests).

Purpose of changes:

 - Update driver and csm_share to fix some SCAM cases. (Also brings in a
   driver fix for NAG builds.)

 - Get CARMA working with debug flags turned on (Lahey, PGI, Intel).

 - Restore WACCM-X hydrogen limiters for calls of physics_update where
   hydrogen (atomic and molecular) is not being modified directly via
   ptend.

 - Fix issues with WACCM and CAM-CHEM debug cases.

 - Fix from Chuck Bardeen for meteor_smoke and pmc CARMA models with
   specified dynamics cases.

 - Fix from Cecile Hannay for the units of NUMLIQ and NUMICE.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

 - SCAM cases that were over ocean, but not aquaplanet cases, were setting
   lnd_present = .false., but not sno_present = .false.
 - CARMA debug cases did not run.
 - WACCM and some CAM-CHEM debug cases failed state_debug_check.

List all subroutines eliminated:

D       models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/arm95_scam.xml

List all subroutines added and what they do:

A       models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/f1.9c5carmdusdm
         - CARMA dust model with debug flags enabled.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

M       SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
         - Pull in update to driver and csm_share with SCAM fix.

M       models/atm/cam/SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
         - Pull in CARMA with fixes for DEBUG mode.
           (See the CARMA log for details about these changes.)

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg_cam.F90
         - Output different units for mass mixing ratios and number
           concentrations (CLDLIQ/CLDICE vs. NUMLIQ/NUMICE).
         - Change units of "#" to the CF-compliant "1".

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/modal_aer_opt.F90
         - Split long lines to stay under 132 character limit.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physics_types.F90
         - Remove conditionals that caused an accidental answer change for
           WACCM-X in cam5_2_21. In isolation, this change restores answers
           that are bit-for-bit with cam5_2_20. However, WACCM-X will not
           be bit-for-bit between this tag and any previous tag, because
           of other changes affecting WACCM chemistry.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physpkg.F90
         - Move clybry_fam_adj call before QNEG3, so that QNEG3 enforces
           the qmin limit on the result, and the subsequent call to
           physics_state_check can pass.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/cam/carma_intr.F90
         - Use carma_do_thermo to prevent access of unallocated array in
           the "CRTT" outfld call.
         - The calls to "set_dry_to_wet" and "set_wet_to_dry" did not
           respect qmin. For now, cause CARMA to operate on a temporary
           copy of the state. CARMA does not deliberately modify the state;
           it only produces a roundoff error due to these two conversions.
         - Change ptend names to differentiate between CARMA tendencies
           originating in different routines.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/models/cirrus/carma_cloudfraction.F90
         - Remove unnecessary use of physics_ptend_init.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/models/meteor_smoke/carma_model_mod.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/models/pmc/carma_model_mod.F90
         - Force internal calculations to use 365 day years, to deal with
           mismatches between year lengths in CARMA and specified dynamics
           files.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/input_tests_master
         - Change CARMA dust test to a debug test.

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
- what platforms/compilers:
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

WACCM and CAM-CHEM - Small (but above roundoff) change due to reordering
                     of clybry_fam_adj and qneg3.
CARMA - Change due to machine roundoff in divide/multiply that is no longer
        executed on the shared physics_state object.

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new

One-line Summary:  Improve rad_diag calcs; add modal aerosol optics diagnostics 
                   scam updates, SE bug fix

Purpose of changes:
. Remove restriction that radiation diagnostic calculations reuse the water
  uptake and wet radius values calculated for the climate affecting modes.
  These quantities are now recomputed for the diagnostic modes.

. Add new diagnostics for modal aerosol optics.

. Make species burdens consistent with mode burdens, i.e., only include
  contributions from daylight columns.

. Add new IOP datasets, use cases, and run script for scam. Along with a 
  date bug fix for scam.

. Minor bug fix and external update for SE from Taylor

. Update svn externals to cesm1_2_beta06, except for pio tag.  PIO has
  an mpi-serial bug.
 
. inic files moved back to homme from se.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Fix bug in configure script for SE


Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
. Added a new namelist variable, history_aero_optics, to add modal aerosol
  optics diagnostics to the default history fields.  The existing
  history_aerosol variable turns on diagnostics related to the aerosol
  production and removal tendencies.

One-line Summary: Add debug checks to physics_update, some chores

Purpose of changes:

 - Add a routine to validate physics_state objects, and provide a
   namelist option to run this routine every time physics_update is
   called.
   - Change ptend%name for some routines to be more informative when
     used in these messages.

 - Fix bug in CARMA netCDF file reads.

 - "endrun" is now a wrapper for "shr_sys_abort" from csm_share. This
   means that ENDRUN will no longer be printed to log files; ERROR
   will be printed instead.

 - For CESM cases, do not re-run configure after a build is complete.

 - Update mkDepends to match Machines version.

 - Standardize checking of error strings with handle_errmsg.

 - Move cprnc to $CESMROOT/tools, matching CESM's layout.
    - This also pulls in a copy of genf90; it's convenient to have
      an updated copy of genf90.pl in the same place in both CESM
      and CAM tags (e.g. to auto-regenerate source code in unit
      tests).
    - The location of cprnc does not seem to be specified anywhere
      in the CAM scripts, so this should be a "harmless" change
      except in any user scripts that build and use cprnc from the
      CAM source.

 - Remove some "#ifdef WACCM_PHYS" in cases where it can be replaced
   with a cheap runtime conditional.

 - Change outputs for CAM-CHEM cases.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

 - Fixed issue with CARMA and a wrap_nf change introduced in
   cam5_2_19.

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

 - Add "state_debug_checks" to phys_control namelist.
   - .true. turns on these checks.
   - Default is .true. for cases passing "-debug" to configure,
     .false. otherwise.

 - Add new use_case (1850-PD_cam5.xml). This is similar to
   1850-2005_cam5.xml but has data from both observations and
   projections, to allow cases to be run longer.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by:

List all subroutines eliminated:

List all subroutines added and what they do:

A       models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/1850-PD_cam5.xml
         - New use_case for new compset (similar to F_AMIP_CAM5 but
           with added data from observations and projections).

In models/atm/cam/src/control/error_messages.F90:
   handle_errmsg:       Checks a string to make sure that it is empty.
                        If it is not empty, it is assumed to be an
                        error message and used to call endrun.

In models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physics_types.F90:
   physics_state_check: Checks for invalid data in a physics_state
                        object. Currently limited to checking for NaN
                        and finiteness, in most cases.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

M       SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
         - Add tools/cprnc.
         - Update csm_share external to get shr_assert_mod.

           built first.
         - Add netCDF to RPATH for Intel builds.

M       models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist

M       models/atm/cam/bld/mkDepends
         - Updated with copy from Machines.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccmx/majorsp_diffusion.F90
         - Changed handling of ptend%name so that routines no longer
           need to alias themselves (e.g. MG's ptend%name was cldwat).
         - Changed/removed settings of ptend%name which were redundant
           or would tend to hide the true source of a change.
         - Error strings coming from portable code now use
           handle_errmsg.
         - Replace compile-time "#ifdef WACCM_PHYS" with run-time
           "if (do_waccm_phys)".

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/error_messages.F90
         - Add "handle_errmsg".

M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/dp_coupling.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/se/dp_coupling.F90
         - State variables initialized by dycore are now actually
           *allocated* by the dycore, if supported.
         - Remove temperature check that is now redundant with a check
           in physpkg.

M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/se/gravity_waves_sources.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/se/pmgrid.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/se/stepon.F90
         - Add save statement needed by XLF on Intrepid.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physics_types.F90
         - Add new state_debug_checks option and routine that
           implements it.
         - Added separate routine to allocate variables needed by
           WACCM and initialized by dycore (uzm, frontgf, and
           frontga).
         - If allocated, uzm, frontgf, and frontga are now copied
           in physics_state_copy.
         - Generalized pergro logic slightly so that microphysics and
           macrophysics routines no longer have to set ptend%name
           to cldwat.
         - Simplify some constituent limiters in physics_update.
         - physics_update now flushes iulog.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physpkg.F90
         - Call physics_state_check at beginning of tphysac and
           tphysbc.
         - Since uzm is part of the state, don't pass it as a separate
           argument to qbo_relax.
         - Remove/shrink some "#ifdef WACCM_PHYS" blocks.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/vertical_diffusion.F90
         - Uses temporary arrays instead of ptend components to hold
           local state.
         - Uses handle_errmsg to check errstring.
         - Replace "#ifdef WACCM_PHYS" with "if (do_waccm_phys)".

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/wv_saturation.F90
         - Use shr_assert_in_domain and handle_errmsg for some checks.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/cam/carma_intr.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/models/dust/carma_model_mod.F90

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/models/pmc/carma_model_mod.F90
         - Change CARMA netCDF reads to use netcdf module and new
           wrap_nf interface.
            - This is a bit hackish; wrap_nf should really just be
              removed.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/gw_drag.F90
         - Check that state fields have been allocated by dycore in
           gw_intr.
         - Minor cleanup in preparation of some strings used as field
           names in outfld (done while debugging a memory issue that
           was actually caused by code elsewhere).

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/qbo.F90
         - Use state%uzm directly instead of requiring it as a
           separate argument to qbo_relax, and check that it is
           allocated first.

M       models/atm/cam/src/utils/abortutils.F90
         - endrun is now just a wrapper for shr_sys_abort.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/zm_conv_intr.F90
         - Comment change.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/CAM_runcmnd.sh
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/archive_baseline.sh
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/test_driver.sh
         - Remove bluefire.
         - test_driver.sh will set the wallclock limit to 2:00 if
           using the "small" (debug) queue on yellowstone.
         - Intel uses -rpath (like other compilers) rather than adding
           $LIB_NETCDF to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/fst7mode1.9c5h
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/fsoa1.9c4dh
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/fsoa4c4dm
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/fst7mode4c5dm
         - Add option -age_of_air_trcs (now required by use_cases).

M       models/atm/cam/tools/README
         - Remove description of cprnc.

Additionally, a number of files with the "svn:executable" property
were not actually executables. This property was removed from files
that were not scripts.

Having svn:mergeinfo on subdirectories can cause merge problems, so
this property was removed from all subdirectories.


If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the
appropriate machine below.  All failed tests must be justified.

yellowstone/intel: All PASS.

Note: Intel compiler version was set to 13 to get the following CESM
comparison test to pass:

frankfurt/lf95: All PASS.

frankfurt/pgi or jaguar/pgi: All PASS.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
- what platforms/compilers:
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

This tag is bit-for-bit except:
cam5_2_19 introduced a roundoff-level change in "igamma" for compilers
that provide a gamma intrinsic function. This only affects the CARMA
dust and seasalt models, and was exposed in this tag (since CARMA
cases did not work in cam5_2_19 and cam5_2_20).

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
- MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:

One-line Summary: NAG port

Purpose of changes:

This allows CAM to compile with the NAG Fortran compiler. The
build will not quite work out of the box; as of this tag, CLM
and CICE tags still must be updated, and MCT requires a patch
to remove "intent" attributes from the MPI interfaces in
m_mpif90.F90.

Not all configurations are ported; the following are still
untested or works in progress:
    - OpenMP threading
    - WACCM-X
    - CARMA
    - CLUBB

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

 - Add NAG support.
 - Get netCDF linking flags from nc-config/nf-config.
     - This should also allow the use of a shared library.
 - Add more debug flags to CAM Makefile for DEBUG cases:
     - Add "-g" to C code (most compilers).
     - Configure MCT with debugging enabled.
 - Update most externals to NAG-compatible versions.
     - All externals are between their cesm1_2_beta05
       and cesm1_2_beta06 versions.
     - This required the addition of a wave component (swav).

D       models/atm/cam/src/utils/gamma_function.F90
         - Functionality moved to shr_spfn_mod (csm_share module).

find_group_name (models/atm/cam/src/utils/namelist_utils.F90)
         - Moved to shr_nl_mod (csm_share module).

List all subroutines added and what they do:

A       models/atm/cam/test/system/tests_pretag_frankfurt_nag
         - NAG pretag test list. Duplicate of Lahey pretag tests.

A       models/atm/cam/bld/get_nxny.pl
         - Script to get nx and ny values from "config_grid.xml" in
           the CESM scripts. These values are needed because they
           must be passed to CICE configure scripts.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

M       SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
         - Update externals to very recent versions (between cesm1_2_beta05
           and cesm1_2_beta06).

M       models/atm/cam/SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
         - Update externals to NAG-compatible versions.

M       models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
M       models/atm/cam/bld/config_files/definition.xml
M       models/atm/cam/bld/configure
         - Add nagfor to compilers.
         - Use netCDF config script to get linking flags.
         - Add -g to CFLAGS for DEBUG builds.
         - Add --enable-debugging option to MCT for DEBUG builds.
         - For NAG, set MCT CFLAGS (override defaults), since otherwise
           there will be binary incompatibilities and/or spurious test
           failures in MCT's configure.
         - Update configure for standalone build with new wav component
           and CICE configure changes.

=====================
There are a number of short changes that had to be made to large numbers of
files. The following is a list of these changes, followed by the list of
all files that had only these changes made. These changes may have also
affected other files.

Changes regarding syntax and Fortran standard compliance:
 - Where a module has both a save statement, and variables declared with the
   save attribute individually, remove the individual save and leave only
   the module-scope save.
    - Additionally, add save statement to some modules where it was missing.
    - Additionally, move include statements of mpif.h above any save
      statements in a module, since mpif.h may include variables with
      the "save" attribute specified individually.
 - Where a procedure gets two arguments, and one is a dimension of the other,
   the arguments may be in either order in the interface, but the dimension
   must be declared first.
 - Break up source code lines longer than the standard length of 132
   characters (72 for fixed-form source).
 - Change non-standard format specifiers to standard equivalents.
 - Always pass reals to procedures requiring a real argument; do not assume
   integers will be converted to real automatically.
 - Pass whole arrays or appropriate slices, rather than passing the first
   element of an array under the assumption that a pointer to the correct
   array location will be passed.
 - Correct some "intent" attributes.

Changes to pointer use:
 - Default-initialize pointers to null() where NAG had detected at runtime
   that they were being used uninitialized.
 - Add "target" attribute to objects for which persistent pointers are
   needed.
 - In cases where pointer dummy arguments must remain associated with some
   memory upon entry to a procedure, declare the dummy arguments with
   "intent(in)" or "intent(inout)", not "intent(out)", regardless of how
   that memory is used.
    - Generally, this does not require changes to pointer dummy arguments,
      since Fortran 95 (and therefore the Lahey compiler) does not allow
      any intent to be specified on pointer dummy arguments. However, some
      derived types have pointer components, and dummy arguments of these
      types must have the correct intent.

Changes to use of libraries and intrinsics:
 - Get F2008 intrinsics that are not present on all compilers (e.g. gamma,
   erfc) from shr_spfn_mod, rather than assuming that all compilers do or
   do not have them.
 - When setting IEEE NaN or Infinity, use the new version of shr_infnan_mod,
   which requires the operator "assignment(=)" to be used.
    - "bigint" was also replaced with huge(1).
    - In some cases, "inf" had to be changed to "posinf" to deal with a
      bug in PGI on Frankfurt.
 - Where the netCDF F77 bindings are used, change to the netCDF F90
   bindings, and also replace any uses of wrap_nf in those modules.
 - Change non-standard complex number intrinsics to generic standard
   intrinsics (e.g. imag to aimag, dcmplx to cmplx).
 - Use CAM's "endrun", not "abort" or "exit" (non-standard extensions).

Other changes:
 - Where required by the above changes, change dimensions of arrays.
   (Usually, from explicit or assumed size to assumed shape.)
 - Add some changes that would have allowed problems described above to
   be detected on other compilers (initialize pointer components to null,
   add explicit intent on procedures).
 - Remove unnecessary code that would otherwise require one of the above
   changes to be made.

*A quick note on external libraries in Fortran:
It is technically not standard-conforming to use generic functions without
explicit interfaces, as in the netCDF and MPI F77 bindings. For netCDF, it
is easy to switch to the Fortran 90 bindings. For MPI, there are some
potential issues with using the MPI module, so instead the "-wmismatch"
argument is used to turn off some of nagfor's compile-time checks.

=====================

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/mo_drydep.F90
         - Change leading dimension of dummy argument rh to "ncol", to
           match the dimensions of the actual argument.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/mo_gas_phase_chemdr.F90
         - Ensure that extfrc and reaction_rates always have non-zero
           size. (When extcnt or rxntot are 0, the arrays will have
           a trailing dimension of 1, but will not actually be used.)
            - Size zero arrays are not a problem with NAG, but these
              arrays have default values assigned, and this cannot be
              done for arrays with no elements to assign.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/mo_setsox.F90
         - Fix a case where a variable that was only set for 7-mode MAM
           was being referenced in all MAM cases.
            - It appears that only 7-mode MAM would actually enter the
              block where this reference occurred, so this caused no
              apparent problems and passed runtime checks on other
              compilers.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/wei96.F90
         - Remove unnecessary common block that impaired readability
           during debugging.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/utils/tracer_data.F90
         - Implemented workaround for a (still poorly understood) bug
           with the netCDF builds on Frankfurt, where netCDF stores
           a pointer to output dimension IDs and then overwrites them.
         - Change "write(*,*)" to "write(iulog,*)".
         - Nullify pointer in specify_fields if it will not be
           allocated.

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/infnan.F90
         - Internal variables replaced with references to shr_infnan_mod.
         - bigint removed; integers that were set to bigint are
           now set to huge(1).

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physics_buffer.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physics_buffer.F90.in
M       models/atm/cam/src/utils/buffer.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/utils/buffer.F90.in
         - Cast physics buffer pointers back to their original type (and
           thus correct size) before deallocating.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/rad_constituents.F90
         - Correct string with subroutine name.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/restart_physics.F90
         - Randomly shuffle use statements to avoid bug with PGI on
           Frankfurt.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/vertical_diffusion.F90
         - Remove assumption that constituents 2 and 3 are cldliq and
           cldice.

M       models/atm/cam/src/utils/cam_dom/ocn_comp.F90
         - Close I/O unit before attempting to reuse it to open a new
           file.

M       models/atm/cam/src/utils/cam_pio_utils.F90
         - Fix integer overflow in find_iodesc.
M       models/atm/cam/src/utils/namelist_utils.F90
         - Now only a wrapper for shr_nl_mod.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/CAM_runcmnd.sh
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/TBR.sh
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/TER.sh
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/TSM.sh
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/test_driver.sh
         - Add NAG to regression test compilers on Frankfurt.
         - For some cases, NAG requires ocn_modelio.nml to be written.
         - Set "ulimit -c unlimited" for Frankfurt, since this is generally
           desirable if a regression test fails, and does not seem to be
           inherited from the user's environment.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/TCB.sh
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/TCB_ccsm.sh
         - Changes necessary to perform standalone build with new CICE,
           wav component, and scripts.

Some files with purely whitespace or comment changes:
M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/modal_aero/modal_aero_coag.F90
M       models/atm/cam/tools/interpic_new/interpolate_data.F90

If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the
appropriate machine below.  All failed tests must be justified.

yellowstone/intel:

082 eq991 TEQ_ccsm.sh f19_f19 F f1.9c4m fcase 2d ..........................FAIL! rc= 7 at Tue Apr  9 05:22:41 MDT 2013
085 bl992 TBL_ccsm.sh f19_g16 ETEST 2d ....................................FAIL! rc= 7 at Tue Apr  9 05:27:33 MDT 2013

The updated version of Machines has a new version of the Intel compilers on
yellowstone. It was therefore expected that some TBL_ccsm tests might fail.

Additionally, TEQ_ccsm tests will fail until either version 13 of the Intel
compiler becomes the default on yellowstone, or test_driver.sh is updated
to specify version 13.

The TEQ_ccsm test did in fact pass with the compiler version bumped:
082 eq991 TEQ_ccsm.sh f19_f19 F f1.9c4m fcase 2d ..........................PASS at Tue Apr  9 11:09:14 MDT 2013

frankfurt/lf95: All PASS.

frankfurt/pgi or jaguar/pgi: All PASS.

One-line Summary: Update externals and namelist for CARMA and HOMME

Purpose of changes:

 - Update CARMA external with several bug fixes. These are described in the
   CARMA ChangeLog at:
         models/atm/cam/src/physics/carma/base/ChangeLog
 - Add use cases for new WACCM/CARMA sulfur and nuclear winter compsets.
 - Source code updates for CARMA sulfate model to interact with chemistry.

 - Update HOMME with NAG-compatible version and bug fix for vector
   Laplacian operation.
 - Updates to HOMME namelist (see below). The most important change is that
   the vertically Lagrangian advection method is now the default.
 - Update namelist_definition.xml to describe HOMME namelist settings in
   more detail (some descriptions and assistance from Mark Taylor).

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

 - For HOMME cases, we use the flag "-DHAVE_F2003_PTR_BND_REMAP", as F2003
   pointer bounds remapping appears to be supported on all current
   compilers (except Lahey, which we no longer test with HOMME). If this
   causes problems, this flag will have to be set on a per-compiler basis
   in CAM's Makefile.in and Machines.

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

 - New CARMA sulfate model flag "carma_do_hetchem" toggles the use of CARMA
   sulfate surface area density in heterogeneous chemistry rate
   calculations.

 - SO2 forcing is no longer automatically added for waccm_mozart_sulfur.

 - Many HOMME changes:
    - Switch from Eulerian to Lagrangian vertical advection method.
    - Turn on energy fixer.
    - Correct nu_p value for ne30np4.
    - Correct both nu_p and nu_div for ne16np4 (necessary for stability).
    - Set default nu_q to -1.D0, which automatically sets nu_q = nu within
      HOMME.
    - ne120np4 with vertically Lagrangian code has experimental settings
      from John Truesdale.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

M       SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
         - Update csm_share external to get new shr_spfn_mod module. This is
           necessary for the NAG port update, including the HOMME external
           pulled in in this tag.

One-line Summary:  Add namelist variables to control history file output, generate 
                   pre cam5_2_13 baselines, waccm sc ic file

Purpose of changes:

.  Namelist variables history_amwg, history_aerosol, history_eddy, and history_budget
   are setup to control the history file outputs.  These are boolean flags that are 
   used to control the add_default calls.  history_amwg is the only one that defaults to
   true.
.  A -b argument was added to test_driver.sh, incase there is a need to generate baselines
   for pre cam5_2_13 tags.  Usage would be test_driver.sh -f -b
.  New better logic in test_driver.sh to handle command line arguments
.  New ne30 initial condition file for waccm_sc_2000_cam4.

One-line Summary: test script improvements, homme update, external updates, bug fixes,
                  change solar namelist defaults

Purpose of changes:

. The default for the solar data namelist variables was being set
  differently for the configurations "-phys cam5 -chem trop_mam3" and
  "-phys cam5 -chem none".  This was changed to make the value for
  prescribed aerosols be the same as for prognostic aerosols.  Also added
  a check to build-namelist to disallow setting both solar_const and
  solar_data_file.  It only makes sense to set one of these variables.

.  Made changes to test scripts to improve testing on yellowstone.  
   - -j option was added to be able to specify number of of jobs for gmake.
     The default setting of -j was unlimited, which was producing slower builds
     than specifying -j 4, -j 8, or -j 16.
   - Fix issues with builds on yellowstone being repeated done when it
     fails to build the first time.
   - Fix issues with builds being tried on yellowstone compute nodes.
   - Add CAM_RBOPTIONS to give more flexibility on how builds are done.
     Valued values are "build_only", "run_only" and "run_and_build"
     CAM_RBOPTIONS is passed to the other test scripts through the argument
     list.  The effect of this change is this tag cannot make a baseline for
     previous tags.
   - Option for pgi testing was added, but not working yet.

.  SVN externals were updated to match cesm1_2_beta02.  
   - Issues with PIO forced the use of a later PIO tag.
   - Also, the Machines tag wasn't updated do to failed tests with intel/13.0.1

. CAM-SE (homme) external was update to homme1_3_17

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

One-line Summary: saturation vapor pressure fixes, WACCM5 fixes

Purpose of changes:
        - Fix problems with saturation vapor pressure schemes
          discovered during development of cam5_2_02.
        - Fix outstanding problems with WACCM5 that cause it to
          crash, by enforcing trop_cloud_top_lev in more modules
          that require this limit.
        - Make treatment of WACCM4 and WACCM5 more consistent. Both
          now set the same top_lev limiter, but some modules perform
          additional checks for CAM5 features to decide if they want
          to use it.
        - Add "rsplit" namelist option for HOMME (courtesy Cecile
          Hannay).

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
     "Meta"bugs:
         1588: Incorrect calculation of saturation specific humidity at
               low pressures throughout CAM
     Bugs:
         1583: zm_conv generates NaN and negative values in saturation mmr
               calculation at low pressure
         1584: radae bypasses checks for low pressure when calculating
               saturation specific humidity
         1585: modal_aero_wateruptake bypasses checks for low pressure in
               saturation specific humidity
         1589: Findsp does not conserve enthalpy for very low temperatures

         - Add top_lev to more loops and array slices.
         - Remove unnecessary/unused logic.
         - The following miscellaneous changes:
           - modal_aero_wateruptake: Change qsat_water call to use
             new version.
           - aer_rad_props: Since trop_cloud_top_lev is now set in WACCM4,
             use it only "if (prog_modal_aero)".
           - cldwat2m_macro: Rename "qsat" to "qs" to avoid confusion with
             wv_saturation intrinsic (and "esat" to "es" to match).
           - cloud_fraction: cldfrc_fice moved from cldwat, and top_lev
             only used if macrop_scheme /= "rk".
           - Microphysics/macrophysics modules: Change indexes to ensure
             that output variables do not contain uninitialized data above
             top_lev.

         - Comment changes only.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cldwat.F90
         - Replace k1mb with top_lev.
         - Update calculation of dqsdt to use new code (and remove check for
           low pressure that is now done in wv_sat_methods).
         - Because cldwat_fice is shared code between CAM4 and CAM5, it
           has been moved to cloud_fraction. The resulting code is only
           used by RK microphysics and thus no longer checks microp_scheme.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radlw.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/zm_conv.F90
         - Update code that did SVP calculations without proper limits for
           low pressure, and/or used a method other than the CAM default.
         - ntopcld moved, and is now max(trop_cloud_top_lev,2).
         - SVP conversion from Pa to hPa has been moved back into zm_conv,
           since the requirement is specific to this module and not used
           by any other CAM module.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physpkg.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/stratiform.F90
         - Moved "inimc" call from physpkg to stratiform, since cldwat
           is not used at all unless RK microphysics is on.
         - Slight simplifications to stratiform constituent logic.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/wv_sat_methods.F90
         - Do proper pressure limiting in qsat/qmmr functions.
         - Changed wv_sat_svp_trans to work correctly for ttrice == 0._r8.
         - Bolton water scheme now outputs in Pa, like the other schemes.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/wv_saturation.F90
         - Remove "legacy" functions and special function for ZM.
         - Remove multiple copies of tmin; SVP calculations are now
           always performed down to 127.16K.
         - Fix findsp enthalpy checking at low temperatures, and generally
           improve consistency/integration with wv_saturation. Enthalpy is
           now always checked to ensure conservation.
           - Note: Findsp used to ENDRUN with a non-convergence error for
             very low temperatures. This (sometimes beneficial) checking
             behavior was unintentional, and only triggered in certain edge
             cases. Now findsp will abort the run only if a problem occurs
             while it is running, and not due to bad input. If necessary,
             temperatures should be checked elsewhere.
         - Cleanup changes:
           - trinv removed.
           - estblf reorganized, and uses kind=r8 in aint.
           - Pull out enthalpy formula for findsp into a function
             (tq_enthalpy).
           - Enthalpy at saturation can now be calculated as an optional
             argument to the qsat routines.
           - Temperature derivative optional outputs from qsat_* routines
             are calculated in a separate (shared) function.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/gw_drag.F90
         - Prevent divide by 0 if wind happens to be exactly 0 at certain
           points.
         - Prevent segfault from certain bad winds by avoiding use of "abs"
           to limit integer indices. This is just to avoid a "red herring"
           crash in gw_drag, when the real problem is elsewhere.

A       models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/wm1.9c5dh
M       models/atm/cam/test/system/input_tests_master
         - WACCM5 test is now a debug test, to catch some common errors
           that occurred during development.
         - Change "outfrq3s" to "outfrq3s_clubb" in CLUBB baseline test.

**All CAM physics cases fail baseline tests due to wv_saturation bug fixes.**



CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
  - All CAM physics cases (everything but ideal and adiabatic).

- what platforms/compilers:
  - All.

- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

   - Above roundoff but same climate as previous version and CESM1.1.1
     This was demonstrated with:

     - A CAM5 present day case (FC5, 1 degree), with code based on
       cam5_2_03, run for 5 years.
     - A fully-coupled 1850 WACCM case (B1850WCN, 2 degree), with code
       based on cam5_2_06, run for 25 years.
       - This run is in the experiment DB with ID #1635.
       - The case name is: b.e11.B1850WCN.f19_g16.test_lim.001
     - A fully-coupled 1850 CAM5 case (B1850C5CN, 2 degree) is also
       in the run database, but has not had its climate compared with
       CESM 1.1.1.
       - ID #1634
       - Case name is b.e11.B1850C5CN.f19_g16.test_lim.001

     - Finite-volume cases are bit-for-bit between cam5_2_06 and
       cam5_2_09, except that there is a roundoff-level difference due
       to changes to shr_reprosum_mod in csm_share.

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
- MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:

URL for AMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:

Tag name: cam5_2_09 
Originator(s): Cheryl Craig
Date: 1/28/13
One-line Summary: Dynamic state,tend,ptend

Purpose of changes:
  - Introduce dynamic state,tend, ptend structures and supporting routines for use with sub-columns
  - eliminated MODAL_AERO ifdef and replaced with rad_constituent interface inside ndrop.F90 (Eaton modification)
  - Removed CLUBB_core from repository and the directory models/atm/cam/src/physics/clubb is now an external library
  - Added Yellowstone pretag test for CLUBB
  - Add module load mkl for CLUBB library
  - renamed sub_column to microp_uniform to better reflect its purpose inside microp routines

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
  - Corrected flag for the intel compiler to ignore temp array creation

Describe any changes made to build system:
  - Introduced new configure parameter "psubcols".  Default is 1 = no subcolumns.  

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
  - Introduced use_subcol_microp - Switch which will be used to control sub-columns within microphysics
    Namelist flag is accessed in phys_control, but it is not used inside CAM yet

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

One-line Summary: Remove SRFRAD, new diagnostics, chem preprocessor build, 
                  update externals, fix dust_emis_fact 

Purpose of changes:
  -Remove unneeded SRFRAD from the monthly averaged output
   AMWG diagnostics uses SRFRAD to compute flwds, but FLDS can 
   used instead.
  -New diagnostics added for aerosol burdens and weed speeds.
  -Update to the chemistry preprocessor to recognize the intel 
   compiler on yellowstone.
  -SVN externals updated to match cesm1_2_beta01 externals.
  -dust_emis_fact was being set to .35 for CAM-SE5, should be set to .55


Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
  -Bugzilla #1618, remove misleading SRFRAD variable

Describe any changes made to build system:
  -New information about the fc_type is being passed to the chemistry
   preprocessor build scripts.  This is to correct a problem with the
   chem preprocessor not recognizing the intel compiler on yellowstone.

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
  -dust_emis_fact was being set to .35 instead of .55 when dyn="homme", tms="1", and
   phys="cam5".  The problem was there was a better match for the .35 value
   than the .55 value.  This was fixed by added tests for tms and phys to the
   .55 value, making it the better match.

One-line Summary: HOMME update, move repro_sum_mod, WACCM-SE

Purpose of changes:

  - Update CESM externals.
   - Note: "setup" has been renamed to "cesm_setup", and
     "env_pesetup.xml" has been renamed back to "env_mach_pes.xml"
   - csm_share updated for to get working (and recently
     improved!) shr_reprosum_mod.
   - During debugging, updated the driver, Machines, and scripts.
     While this was unnecessary, these were verified BFB, so
     were updated anyway.
   - RTM had to be updated for the driver update. build_namelist
     had to be updated due to RTM namelist changes. Note that
     standalone CAM has RTM off by default, so no answer changes.

 - Update HOMME external (and make changes to interface layer
   to accomodate this).
 - Add changes that were waiting on this update:
   - repro_sum_mod is deleted, and modules now use
     shr_reprosum_mod from csm_share
   - New routine and first namelist options for WACCM-SE
     (WACCM+HOMME, still under development).
 - Fix WACCM5 restart test that fails since cam5_2_05 (diagnostic
   variables were not being initialized above top_lev, so random
   unused garbage above that level was in the output files).
 - Fix HOMME settings for ne120np4.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

 - Replace do_rtm = .false. with rtm_mode = "NULL", for RTM update.

 - Standalone CAM still allows modification of reprosum module
   options, but these are now written to a driver namelist.

 - New HOMME settings for ne120np4.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

        - Eliminated in favor of shr_reprosum_mod in csm_share.

List all subroutines added and what they do:

A       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/gravity_waves_sources.F90
        - New module with HOMME-compatible frontogenesis calculation

M       models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/waccm_sc_2000_cam4.xml
        - WACCM-SE defaults for ne30np4.
        - Specify which defaults in the use_cases are for fv only.
        - Add ne30np4 data set for FWSC compset.
	- Fix default parameters for ne120np4 resolution.

M       models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
        - Move RTM and reprosum options (see above).

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/modal_aero/modal_aero_rename.F90
        - Remove use of shr_kind_r4 (cleanup).

        - Change use of repro_sum_mod to shr_reprosum_mod.

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_comp.F90
        - Nullify pointers in module scope.

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_restart.F90
        - Change dyn_in/dyn_out declarations to "intent(inout)"
          (to preserve allocation of pointer components).

M       models/atm/cam/src/control/runtime_opts.F90
        - Remove processing of repro_sum_mod options.

M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/ctem.F90
        - Put explicit limits on arrays in par_xsum call (leftover
          cleanup from debugging, will be necessary for NAG).

M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/dp_coupling.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_control.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physics_types.F90
        - Remove WACCM_PHYS "ifdef" statements in favor of equivalent
          runtime switch in phys_control.
        - When dynamic state changes arrive, this will also be used
          to change allocation of frontgf/frontga.

D       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/gravity_waves_sources.F90
A       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/gravity_waves_sources.F90
        - Moved FV-specific gravity_waves_sources from WACCM, since
          this module is dycore-specific.

M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/dp_coupling.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/stepon.F90
        - Add call to gravity_waves_sources for WACCM.
        - HOMME update changes (see below).
        - Check for negative temperatures in d_p_coupling and abort
          with a debug message if any are found.

M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/dyn_comp.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/dyn_grid.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/inidat.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/restart_dynamics.F90
        - Change interface to HOMME for the updated version.
          - Remove timelevel dimension from elem%state%Q.
          - Add calls to Timelevel_Qdp to get Qdp-specific timelevel
            index.
          - Rename references to "cslam" to "fvm".
        - Remove logic for deprecated or removed options.
          - "leapfrog" scheme not supported.
          - tracer_advection_formulation is now always
            TRACERADV_TOTAL_DIVERGENCE.
        - dyn_import_t and dyn_export_t are now created with pointer
          components nullified. This means that they usually must be
          "intent(inout)" arguments to maintain those pointers'
          association. (Using "intent(out)" was already incorrect
          Fortran, but still worked with most compilers.)

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/geopotential.F90
        - Changed arrays to assumed shape in order to prevent
          creation of temporary copies (flagged by ifort).

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg1_5.F90
        - Change mistaken use of qin to qi (bug fix for
          sub_column=.true., which is not yet turned on).
        - Correct spelling of "heterogeneous".

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg_cam.F90
        - Initialize diagnostic output above top_lev (prevents
          garbage from being output above top_lev in WACCM5).

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/pkg_cld_sediment.F90
M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/vertical_diffusion.F90
        - Pure cleanup changes.

M       models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/qbo.F90
        - Removed unused FV-specific dependencies. QBO forcing does
          not currently work with HOMME, but removing these dependencies
          is necessary for the module to be compiled in a HOMME case.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/archive_baseline.sh
        - New script for archiving CAM regression test baselines on
          current testing machines.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/TCB_ccsm.sh
        - Update for CESM scripts.

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/test_driver.sh
        - Remove "impi" module on yellowstone, as MPICH is supposedly
          faster.

M       models/atm/cam/tools/interpic_new/Makefile
        - Add ifort and make it default compiler (so that interpic_new
          can be used on yellowstone out-of-the-box).

If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the
appropriate machine below.  All failed tests must be justified.

 - All baselines using the HOMME dycore are expected to fail due to
   the updated external.
 - All baselines for cases that used repro_sum_mod are expected to
   fail due to updates to the csm_share version.
   - In practice, this means HOMME cases (which would fail baseline
     tests anyway), and most FV cases.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations: HOMME and FV dycores
- what platforms/compilers: all
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): roundoff (due to shr_reprosum_mod and HOMME)

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?
 - Testing of shr_reprosum_mod and HOMME output outside of CAM.

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
- MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:

URL for AMWG diagnostics output used to validate new climate:

One-line Summary: bug fix for yellowstone

Purpose of changes: 
. Use cam erfc function in modal_aero_rename.F90 instead
  of intrinsic erfc function.  This is to get around an error
  on yellowstone.
. Change the queue name for the yellowstone test build 
  script from caldera go gpgpu.  This will give you a 
  dedicated node on caldera, instead of sharing a node.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by: fischer

List all subroutines eliminated:

List all subroutines added and what they do:

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

M       models/atm/cam/test/system/test_driver.sh
.  Changed caldera queue to gpgpu to get a dedicate node on caldera to do
   the pre builds.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/modal_aero/modal_aero_rename.F90
.  Use cam erfc function instead of intrinsic erfc.  Will cause answer 
   changes for cam5.

If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the
appropriate machine below.  All failed tests must be justified.

One-line Summary: New "MG1.5" microphysics scheme

Purpose of changes:
 - Added new microphysics scheme 'mg1.5', the next development
   version of the Morrison & Gettelman stratiform cloud microphysics.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
 - Bug 1600: CARMA cirrus model fails in build_namelist in cam5_2_02
    - This bug was introduced in cam5_2_02, when the name of wvsat_scheme
      was changed to wv_sat_scheme. The name was not changed in the
      add_default call in build_namelist, so the cirrus model would not
      build.

Describe any changes made to build system:
 - Added mg1.5 option to -microphys configure option.

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
 - Added micro_mg_version and micro_mg_sub_version (MG version numbers).

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated:

List all subroutines added and what they do:

A       models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg1_5.F90
         - Alternative microphysics related to micro_mg.F90

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

M       models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
         - Add micro_mg_version and micro_mg_sub_version to
           represent the version number of MG.
         - Fix bug with CARMA cirrus model and wv_sat_scheme.

M       models/atm/cam/bld/config_files/definition.xml
M       models/atm/cam/bld/configure
	 - Added "mg1.5" as valid option for -microphys.
         - "mg" is preserved as an alias for the old microphysics (which
           is now "mg1").

M       models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
M       models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
         - Add version number for MG.
	 - Added 1.9x2.5 MG1.5 defaults for cldfrc_rhminl and uwshcu_rpen.

M       models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/utils/tracer_data.F90
         - Initialize pointers in derived types to null (bug fix for
           gfortran, courtesy jedwards).

 - On all systems, CAM5 baselines were expected to fail due to a change in
   diagnostic output. Outside of this output, the model is bit-for-bit.

 - The changes are in these variables: AREI AREL AWNC AWNI FREQI FREQL

 - The only difference is that these variables are now scaled by the
   cloud fraction (liquid or ice, as appropriate).

One-line Summary: build changes for yellowstone; remove LCLOUD from default hist output

Purpose of changes:

. Made mods to configure and Makefile.in to account for new compiler
  wrappers used on yellowstone.
. Made some changes to the MCT build part of CAM's configure to allow
  trapping the error return from the MCT configure script.
. Modified the Makefile rules used by configure's -test option so they work
  with the recent changes to build MCT as a separate lib.
. Remove LCLOUD from the default history output.  It is only used by the
  stratus cloud activation, and is not the same as the fraction of liquid
  stratus which is available as LIQCLDF (but is not output by default).
. Move the addfld/outfld calls for AST, LIQCLDF, ICECLDF from micro_mg_cam
  to macrop_driver since these fields are computed by the macrophysics.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 

. fix addfld call for EMIS in cam5 radiation (rrtmg).

Describe any changes made to build system: 

. mods for yellowstone and MCT build as noted above

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: none

List all subroutines added and what they do: none

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. set default CC to mpicc when mpif90 is the fortran compiler
. fix the check for the return status of the MCT configure command

models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
. fix the rules for building test_fc and test_nc by removing the
  specification of $(LDFLAGS).  Now that we build MCT as a separate lib,
  these rules were failing because LDFLAGS contains -lmct which doesn't
  exist yet.  Similar fixes for test_mpi and test_esmf.  Had to add
  $(FFLAGS) to the link commands to pick up the OpenMP flags that
  are in the $(LDFLAGS) macro which was removed.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/microp_aero.F90
. add addfld/outfld call for LCLOUD (moved from ndrop).  Modify long_name
  to 'Liquid cloud fraction used in stratus activation'

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/ndrop.F90
. move addfld call for LCLOUD to microp_aero.F90 and remove the add_default
  and outfld calls.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/macrop_driver.F90
. add addfld/outfld calls for AST, LIQCLDF, ICECLDF

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg_cam.F90
. remove addfld/outfld calls for AST, LIQCLDF, ICECLDF (move to

. fix addfld call for EMIS.  change number of levels from 1 to plev, and
  changed default averaging from 'I' to 'A'

One-line Summary: namelist updates, bug fixes

Purpose of changes:

. In cam_diagnostics.F90, the default diagnostic that dqcond is used to
  compute is only written to the history file for 1 constituent (specific
  humidity).  The memory for the other pcnst-1 constituents is allocated and
  set but not used.  In the case where the diagnostic is written for all
  pcnst constituents the data structure was modified to avoid index addresses 
  that don't fit into 32 bit integers. 

. cam's configure script needed to be fixed to pass $mpi_inc and $mpi_lib to the
  MCT configure script, when mpi_inc and mpi_lib are passed in from the configure
  argument list.

. update svn externals to match cesm1_1_alpha18g. 

. Namelist updates for waccmx, sd-waccm and homme.
 
Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:
. cam configure was updated to pass mpi_lib and mpi_inc, being
  set by arguments to cam's configure, to MCT configure

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
. set dust_emis_fact to .55 for homme
. set so2_emis_file for sd_waccm use_cases
. clm_rtm_inparm group moved to clm_inparm

One-line Summary: SE/cam5 tuning mods; mods for SE in standalone mode; some code cleanup.

Purpose of changes:

. Add tuning mods for SE/cam5 configurations.  Also add "tuned" topo
  dataset for ne30np4.

. Mods to CAM standalone build to support running SE in F compset
  configurations (i.e., active land, thermodynamic cice, and data ocean).
  Up to now the standalone build has only worked for SE running in
  adiabatic, ideal physics, or aquaplanet configurations.

. Some cleanup in the dynamics initialization layer.  In particular remove
  a bunch of dead code from the SE dynamics interfaces.

. The attempt to access the initial file from the dyn_init routine created
  a circular dependency.  Accessing the initial file in the dyn_comp module
  requires it to use startup_initialconds.  But startup_initialconds
  depends on dyn_comp because of the initial_conds method.  Resolve this by
  separating the code that opens the initial and topo files (and is not
  dycore dependent) from the initial_conds routine which reads the initial
  file and is dycore dependent.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

One-line Summary: CLUBB and two minor changes for trunk

Purpose of changes:

- Introduction of CLUBB onto CAM trunk.  CLUBB (Cloud Layers Unified by Bi-normals) is a 
  higher-order turbulence closure centered around an assumed double Guassian PDF.  It is 
  a unified parameterization in that it returns tendencies due to PBL, shallow convection, 
  and cloud macrophysical processes.  This unified moist turbulence parameterization 
  uses multivariate PDFs to predict moments to generate shallow and stratiform clouds 
  that are then passed to the microphysics.

One-line Summary: cleanup in stratiform, macrop, microp modules; new namelist

Purpose of changes:

. Remove lots of unused code left over from the original cam5 development.
  This was a consequence of the cam5 macro/micro physics being developed in
  the stratiform module, and then later moved to separate macrop and
  micro_mg modules.  The result was code that's only needed for the cam5
  physics was left in the stratiform module, and code that's only needed for
  cam4 physics was left in the macrop and micro_mg modules.

. Move several pbuf_add calls to the modules that are responsible for
  setting the pbuf field.

. Add namelist group microp_aero_nl to the microp_aero module.  Currently
  just contains the variable microp_aero_bulk_scale which is a tuning
  parameter for using bulk aerosols with the cam5 physics package.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
. occasionally the serial builds were failing due to trying to compile the
  pio_kinds.F90 before the mct build was finished.  This fails because in
  the serial build the mpi-serial lib is part of mct, and that build puts
  the mpif.h file in the appropriate include directory.  For now have added
  a rule to make pio_kind.o depend on libmct.a.

. remove calls to add SH_FRAC, DP_FRAC to pbuf.  Now done in
  cldfrc_register. 
. remove pbuf_add calls for TINI, QINI, CLDLIQINI, CLDICEINI.  Now done in
  phys_register. 
. remove access of QME -- not used

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/microp_aero.F90
. add microp_aero_readnl, and microp_aero_bulk_scale for tuning the
  activation by bulk aerosol.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physpkg.F90
. call cldfrc_register from phys_register
. add pbuf_add calls for TINI, QINI, CLDLIQINI, CLDICEINI (used for physics
  package diagnostics).
. move initializer for CLDO to microp_mg_cam

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/stratiform.F90
. remove micro_treatment parameter which isn't relevent for cam4
. Remove RHDFDA and RHU00 from pbuf and use local variables only.
  rhu00 is computed in cldfrc, then used to compute rhdfda, and is
  intent(in) to pcond.
  rhdfda is computed then used as intent(in) arg to pcond.  There is no
  use of saved values.
. remove many unused local variables
. remove AIST,ALST from pbuf.  Replace local use by ast.
. remove LIQCLDF, ICECLDF from hist.  They are identical to AST.
. remove CLDO, CONCLD_QL, ICCWAT, REL_FN, DEICONV, MUCONV, LAMBDACONV
  from pbuf.  Not used.
. remove pbuf_add calls for SH_FRAC, DP_FRAC.  Now done in

One-line Summary: update SVN exteranals, build MCT library separately

Purpose of changes:
.  There are a couple of changes with the cesm build scripts with the new
   scripts tag.
   .  The command line command "configure -case" has been replace with "setup"
   .  env_configure.xml has been renamed env_pesetup.xml

.  Update SVN externals to match cesm1_1_beta17, except for clm4_0_47
   and pio1_5_4.  These are later tags that are a bug fix for cam and
   a fix for lahey

.  With the new tag for MCT, the MCT configure script must be run.  So
   configure and Makefile.in were updated to handle these changes.  A new
   varaible mct_libdir was added to be able to set the location of the mct
   library.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:
.  MCT is now built as a stand alone library.  In order to build mct, changes
   where made to configure and Makefile.in.  
    .FC, FC_TYPE, and cc are now determined in configure instead of Makefile.in.  
    .cam's configure script creates a directory structure in $mct_libdir and copies the MCT 
     makefiles over.  
    .MCT's configure script is called in order to set up MCT's Makefile.conf.  
    .CAM's Makefile.in has new rules to build the MCT library.
    .$mct_libdir default is $cam_bld/mct, can be set on the command line -mct_libdir, or 
     enviroment variable MCT_LIBDIR.

One-line Summary: Remove hardcoded zvir from cam4 physics.

Purpose of changes:

. Call the init routine for the pbl_utils from phys_init, not from
  init_eddy_diff and init_hb_diff.  This wasn't done previously because a
  local value of zvir (0.61) was being used in the hb_diff module.  Using a
  single call to the init routine which uses the shared value of constants
  will change answers (but not climate) for cam3/cam4 physics.

One-line Summary: fix vertical_diffusion pbuf fields

Purpose of changes:

. Several of the fields put in the physics buffer by the vertical diffusion
  module were using the special pbuf_times dimension incorrectly.  This
  only results in a bug for the Eulerian dycore (and hence SCAM) since
  that's the only dycore for which pbuf_times is greater than 1.
  The dimension was removed for the following fields:

  - tke is in the buffer to be communicated to microp_aero.  There is no
    need for multiple time levels when the purpose is just to share a the
    most recently computed values of a diagnostic.  In fact subtle mistakes
    will result when the data consuming module executes before the data
    producing module in the tphysbc then tphysac sequence, and both modules
    are using the pbuf_old_tim_idx to access the buffer.  In the particular
    case of tke the bug was that it was being accessed in microp_aero as if
    it did not even have a pbuf_times dimension.
  - kvh is used by other parameterizations, and as an initial guess in
    compute_eddy_diff on subsequent timesteps.  In the Eulerian case it
    probably doesn't make sense to use values that are 2 timesteps old as
    initial guesses rather than 1 timestep old values.  Furthermore this
    field was being accessed in microp_aero and ndrop as if it did not have
    a pbuf_times dimension.
  - kvm, tauresx, and tauresy are in the pbuf to be used as an initial
    guesses on the next timestep.
  - turbtype and smaw are not currently needed in the pbuf.
  - kvt is only used by the waccm/gw_drag code.  Only the information just
    computed in vertical_diffusion needs to be passed (not multiple time
    levels).

. Change default vertical remap subcycles for 1-deg FV to nspltvrm=2.  This
  is to make the 1-deg simulation more stable.

. Fix T_TTEND output diagnostic.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Several physics buffer fields declared with the pbuf_times dimension were
  being incorrectly accessed.  This is only a bug for cam5 physics using
  Eulerian dycore.  Note in particular that this affects SCAM.

. The T_TTEND diagnostic had the wrong sign, and due to incorrect use of
  the physics buffer was completely invalid for runs using Eulerian dycore.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. Change default value of nspltvrm to 2 for 1-deg FV.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

. The change of nspltvrm to 2 for 1-deg FV does add an overhead which will
  be noticable (5% ?) but hasn't been thoroughly evaluated.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
. set nspltvrm=2 for 1-deg FV

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cam_diagnostics.F90
. Fix access to tke, kvh, kvm (now 2D instead of 3D)
. Fix T_TTEND output diagnostic:
  - T_TTEND was added to the pbuf with a pbuf_times index, but was accessing
    the field ignoring that index.  For the Eulerian core this implies that
    on some steps the previous timestep value was accessed, and on the
    following steps the value from 2 previous timesteps was accessed.  When
    computing tendencies for Eulerian the ztodt variable contains twice the
    physics timestep, so need to always access the pbuf values from 2
    timesteps previous using the pbuf_old_tim_idx function.
  - In the diag_conv_tend_ini routine only initialize the T_TTEND pbuf on the
    first step of an initial run, and initialize all pbuf_times levels.
  - Fix the sign of the T_TTEND tendency calculation.

  from call to gw_intr

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/stratiform.F90
. remove tke which is referenced but not used.  It is also initialized
  which overwrites the initialization in physpkg.  But shouldn't impact
  answers because it isn't used by the hack shallow convection.
. remove kvh which is referenced but not used.  It is also initialized
  which overwrites the initialization in physpkg.  Shouldn't impact cam4 
  answers unless running with IC file that contained KVH.
. remove turbtype and smaw which are referenced but not used

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/tracers_suite.F90
. comment out debug output

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/vertical_diffusion.F90
. remove pbuf_times dimension from tke.  it is set in compute_eddy_diff or
  compute_hb_diff and used in moist physics to estimate subgrid vertical
  velocity.  **N.B.** was being incorrectly accessed without the pbuf_times
  dimension in microp_aero.
. remove pbuf_times dimension from kvh.  kvh in the pbuf is used by other
  physics parameterizations, and as an initial guess in compute_eddy_diff
  on the next timestep.  **N.B.** was being incorrectly accessed without
  the pbuf_times dimension in microp_aero and in ndrop.
. remove pbuf_times dimension from kvm.  kvm in the pbuf is only used as an
  initial guess in compute_eddy_diff on the next timestep.  Thus the kvm
  field in the pbuf does not contain the contributions from molecular
  diffusion that are added in the call to compute_vdiff.
. remove pbuf_times dimension from turbtype and smaw.  these fields in the
  pbuf are currently not used, but may be in the future.  Also can remove
  the pbuf_set_field to zero for the HB case since the fields are init to
  zero and not modified.
. tauresx and tauresy are only in the pbuf to be used as initial guesses in
  subsequent timesteps.  No need for multiple time levels.

. kvt only needs one time level and physpkg scope.
. kvt is set before it is used anywhere -- doesn't need an initialization
  in vertical_diffusion_init
. change local array for kvt to pointer into pbuf
. remove obsolete comment about calc_kvt
. associate kvt pointer with pbuf and remove the copy of the local kvt into
  the pbuf.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/gw_drag.F90
. remove dummy arg kvt and access from pbuf instead.  add init for
  kvt_idx.  modify indexing to account for pbuf field using 1 based
  indices.

One-line Summary: remove dependencies in phys_control, vert diffusion cleanup

Purpose of changes:
 - To break the dependency of phys_control on ref_pres (and thus on the
   dynamics and physconst).
 - Move namelist options from phys_control to vertical_diffusion.
 - Remove #ifdef MODAL_AERO from vertical_diffusion.
 - Make trb_mtn_stress module fully portable.
 - General cleanup (remove goto statements, unnecessary code).

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

 - ref_pres_nl handles options for the reference pressure module.
 - trop_cloud_top_press is defined in namelist_definitions and
   always added by build_namelist.
   - Value for cam5 is 100 Pa. Currently only WACCM configurations
     go above this level.
   - Value for cam4 is currently 0 Pa. (CAM 4 uses k1mb as the
     microphysics top instead.)

 - The following namelist variables were moved from phys_control to
   vertical_diffusion:
   - do_iss
   - do_tms
   - tms_orocnst
   - tms_z0fac
   - vdiff_compute_obklen

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by: Brian Eaton

List all subroutines eliminated:

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_control.F90 :: phys_ctl_init
models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_control.F90 :: trop_cloud_top_init
 - These set various top/bottom levels for vertical_diffusion and the
   cloud physics, respectively.
 - Their functionality has been split between routines in other
   modules, in order to remove dependence on ref_pres.

List all subroutines added and what they do:

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/diffusion_solver.F90 :: new_fieldlist_vdiff
 - Returns a new vdiff_selector ("fieldlist") object, given a
   constituent number.
 - Split fieldlist creation subroutine off of init_vdiff so that
   module does not have to be re-initialized by eddy_diff.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/rad_constituents.F90 :: rad_cnst_get_mam_mmr_idx
models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/rad_constituents.F90 :: rad_cnst_get_mode_num_idx
 - Get constituent indices of mam species mass mixing ratio, and mode
   number mixing ratio, respectively.
 - Used in cleanup of vertical diffusion.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/ref_pres.F90 :: ref_pres_readnl
 - Namelist parser for ref_pres.
 - Added to move trop_cloud_top_press option from phys_control.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
 - Added trop_cloud_top_press to namelist.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
 - Added trop_cloud_top_press, moved options from phys_control to
   vertical_diffusion.

models/atm/cam/src/control/runtime_opts.F90
 - Added ref_pres namelist.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cldwat2m_macro.F90
models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cloud_fraction.F90
models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg_cam.F90
models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/microp_aero.F90
models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/ndrop_bam.F90
 - Updated location of trop_cloud_top_lev from phys_control to ref_pres.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/diffusion_solver.F90
 - do_iss is set by input argument rather than gotten from phys_control.
 - Fieldlists are created by new_fieldlist_vdiff rather than init_vdiff.
 - vdiff_selector uses an allocatable list rather than a pointer, and
   the .not. and "any" operators operate without slicing. (Adding "(:)"
   actually does produce a semantic difference, though one that's
   irrelevant here!)

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/eddy_diff.F90
 - Get fieldlists from new_fieldlist_vdiff rather than init_vdiff.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/molec_diff.F90
 - Use errstring argument to init_molec_diff to remove iulog and endrun
   dependencies.
 - init_molec_diff now calculates top/bottom of molecular diffusion

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_control.F90
 - To remove ref_pres dependence, the following were removed
   from this module, and correspondingly from phys_getopts:
   - trop_cloud_top_init
     - trop_cloud_top_lev
     - trop_cloud_top_press
   - phys_ctl_init
     - do_molec_diff
     - ntop_eddy/nbot_eddy
     - ntop_molec/nbot_molec
 - Because they relate specifically to vertical_diffusion, the following
   were also removed:
   - do_iss
   - do_tms
   - tms_orocnst
   - tms_z0fac
   - vdiff_compute_obklen

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physpkg.F90
 - phys_ctl_init and trop_cloud_top_init calls removed.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/rad_constituents.F90
 - Added rad_cnst_get_mam_mmr_idx and rad_cnst_get_mode_num_idx.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/ref_pres.F90
 - Added ref_pres_readnl.
 - Add trop_cloud_top_lev calculation.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/trb_mtn_stress.F90
 - Used errstring to remove dependency on iulog, took dependence on
   shr_const_mod back out.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/tropopause.F90
 - Replaced goto statements with cycle/exit.
 - Comment typo fixes.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/vertical_diffusion.F90
 - Added variables to namelist from phys_control.
 - vertical_diffusion now decides if molecular diffusion will be done.
 - ntop_molec/nbot_molec are returned from init_molec_diff, not phys_getopts.
 - vertical_diffusion now determines ntop_eddy/nbot_eddy values.
 - Uses new_fieldlist_vdiff.
 - Handles new errstring outputs from init_molec_diff and init_tms.
 - New rad_constituent procedures and prog_modal_aero used to remove
   #ifdef MODAL_AERO statements.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/rad_solar_var.F90
 - Used DIM argument to maxloc to change size 1 vector to scalar.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/gw_drag.F90
 - nbot_molec used from molec_diff rather than queried from phys_getopts

models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccmx/majorsp_diffusion.F90
 - Unused Boltzmann constant removed.
 - ntop_molec/nbot_molec used from molec_diff rather than phys_control.
 - Do loop guaranteed to have exactly one iteration removed (replaced
   with simple assignment).


If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the
appropriate machine below.  All failed tests must be justified.

  pes layouts, or phys_loadbalance changes.
. Added ability to set tunings differently depending on the ocean model
. Merge with cam1/branch_tags/camse_cam5_1_27_tags/01_camse_cam5_1_27/
  Updates for homme, memory reduction
  Changes to vert_remap_q_alg in namelist_defaults_cam.xml

One-line Summary: CARMA added, sathist multiple columns, cleanup

Purpose of changes:

 - Add CARMA (Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres),
   along with several CARMA models:
   - bc_strat
   - cirrus
   - meteor_smoke
   - pmc
   - sea_salt
   - sulfate
   As well as basic test/tutorial models for CARMA:
   - test_detrain
   - test_growth
   - test_passive
   - test_radiative
   - test_swelling

 - Add new chemistry package: waccm_mozart_sulfur, usable with
   the CARMA sulfate model.

 - New features used by CARMA, but potentially relevant outside of
   CARMA, include:
     - The ability to turn off some processes in MG microphysics and
       Park macrophysics.
     - A flag specifying the stage at which a constituent will undergo
       convective transport.
     - New spectral flux outputs for radiation.
     - The ability to calculate the Obukhov length outside the HB/HBR
       eddy scheme.

 - Allow sat_hist to use more than one column near a given point, as
   well as giving columns from more than one timestep, to allow
   interpolation in time and space.

 - Update/add to WACCM namelist defaults for certain configurations.

 - Tweaked forcing from meteorological data.

 - Improve Darwin parallel support.

 - Minor cleanup to RRTMG.

 - Some options from cldwat have been moved into cloud_fraction.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

 - Bug #1475 has been partially addressed by this tag, which removed
   the faulty option (liu_in == .true. is the only valid behavior for
   MG microphysics). The faulty functionality will be restored with
   the addition of further ice nucleation options in a future tag.

Describe any changes made to build system:

 - Improved support for compilation using Darwin.

 - Added configure and namelist options specific to CARMA and
   waccm_mozart_sulfur, including also.

 - Namelist variables for new satellite history, RRTMG spectral
   (per-band) fluxes, changing wv_saturation scheme.

 - Moved/combined some variables from cldwat to cloud_fraction
   (cldfrc).

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

 - New defaults for certain WACCM resolutions:

       <ncdata dyn="fv"  hgrid="1.9x2.5"   nlev="64"  ic_ymd="101"     >atm/cam/inic/fv/cami_0000-01-01_1.9x2.5_L64_c070703.nc</ncdata>

 - WACCM emissions files updated:

         <nox_emis_file  chem="waccm_mozart">atm/cam/chem/1850-2000_emis/IPCC_emissions_houw_NOx_1850-2000_1.9x2.5.c090728.nc</nox_emis_file>

      <eddy_max_bot_pressure                >100.e3</eddy_max_bot_pressure>
      <diff_cnsrv_mass_check                > .false. </diff_cnsrv_mass_check>

M    models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/master_drydep_list.xml
M    models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/master_gas_wetdep_list.xml
        - Added H2SO4 to main gas phase lists.
        - Removed MAM-specific drydep entry to prevent
          double-counting.

M    models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
M    models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
M    models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
M    models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/waccm_2000_cam4.xml
        - Added CARMA, waccm_mozart_sulfur, and sathist options.
        - New files for various WACCM resolutions.
        - Updated WACCM emis_file defaults (but usually overridden by
          use case defaults anyway).
        - Eddy diffusion defaults now set in namelist_defaults_cam.

M    models/atm/cam/bld/perl5lib/Build/ChemNamelist.pm
        - Tweaks to gas_wetdep_list moved from build-namelist to
          set_dep_lists.
        - Avoid changing answers for trop_mam due to
          waccm_mozart_sulfur's addition of H2SO4 to gas wetdep.

M    models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/bulk_aero/aerosol_intr.F90
        - Notify hub2atm if CARMA is doing drydep.

M    models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/bulk_aero/wetdep.F90
        - is_strat_cloudborne handled properly as optional argument
          rather than using #ifdef MODAL_AERO statements.

M    models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/utils/modal_aero_calcsize.F90
        - Unnecessary use statement removed.

M    models/atm/cam/src/control/physconst.F90
        - Some constants from shr_const_mod are now used instead of
          recalculated with identical formulae.

M    models/atm/cam/src/control/runtime_opts.F90
        - Add CARMA readnl, microp/macrop driver readnl, and the new
          RRTMG spectralflux option.

M    models/atm/cam/src/control/sat_hist.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/eul/dyn_grid.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/dyn_grid.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/dyn_grid.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/sld/dyn_grid.F90
        - Now can use n closest columns to a given point, rather than
          only the nearest column.
        - sat_hist.F90 can output multiple timesteps as well.
        - Distance is now the great circle distance rather than
          lon^2+lat^2 (this will change the closest column found in
          some cases, particularly unstructured grids, points near 0
          degrees longitude, and points near the poles).

M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/eul/grmult.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/sld/grmult.F90
        - Replaced call to virtem with equivalent one-liner.

M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/eul/inidat.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/inidat.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/inidat.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/sld/inidat.F90
        - Add CARMA constituents.

M    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/metdata.F90
        - Meteorological data nudges, rather than forces, some CAM
          fields by default.
        - New namelist variable met_srf_nudge_flux can be set to
          .false. to recover the old behavior.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cldwat2m_macro.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cloud_fraction.F90
        - Account for CARMA's processes without trying to redo them.
        - Some subroutines made publically available for CARMA.
        - Some parameters now housed in cloud_fraction and read in
          from the namelist rather than set between cldwat2m_macro
          and cloud_fraction.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/macrop_driver.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/micro_mg_cam.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/microp_driver.F90
        - Account for physical processes executed by CARMA.
        - New namelist flags to control this behavior, and new readnl
          methods to get those flags.
        - The liu_in option has been removed, since setting it to
          false has produced garbage for some time now. See bug
          #1475 in bugzilla.
        - microp_driver now uses switch statement rather than if (this
          anticipates MG2 and/or other potential new schemes it will
          have to handle).

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/constituents.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/stratiform.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/zm_conv_intr.F90
        - Added flag for constituents to undergo convective transport
          in first or second stage.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/eddy_diff.F90
        - Instead of trbintd, ustar now calculated from new calc_ustar
          subroutine in pbl_utils.
        - Surface density now output with ustar.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/hb_diff.F90
        - Made clear that the module declares and uses its own value
          for zvir.
        - Added HB_ri field for Richardson number.
        - Use routines from pbl_utils to calculate virtual
          temperature, ustar, kinematic surface fluxes, and Obukhov
          length.
        - Virtual temperature is now only calculated once and reused,
          rather than recalculated several times.
        - Removed now-unnecessary arguments from several routines.
        - Instead of all constituent fluxes being input, only uses
          water vapor.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/ndrop_bam.F90
        - Aerosols with no defined dispersion exempted from CCN loops.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_control.F90
        - Added wvsat_scheme option, since the scheme can now be
          changed.
        - Added flag vdiff_compute_obklen to force computation of
          Obukhov length outside the vertical diffusion.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_grid.F90
        - Added phys_grid_find_cols, identical to phys_grid_find_col
          except that it finds multiple nearest columns and uses the
          great circle distance to find them.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_prop.F90
        - Added 'trim' to string included in endrun message.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physpkg.F90
        - Set convective transport stage for water vapor.
        - Added calls to CARMA.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radconstants.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radsw.F90
        - CAMRT's radsw no longer thinks it's clever to sneak an index
          into the hundredth's place of a float. Sure, it seemed like
          the thing to do when it was young and headstrong, but times
          have changed, and radsw.F90 has grown up. It has adopted the
          more conventional approach of accepting a separate integer
          array from radconstants.
        - Accordingly, wavmin and wavmax are only available through
          an improved accessor function.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radiation.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radiation.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radlw.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radsw.F90
        - Added new spectralflux option. Only used in RRTMG.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/vertical_diffusion.F90
        - No longer sets defaults that are always provided via
          namelist.
        - Accomodates changes in eddy diffusion subroutine arguments.
        - If vdiff_compute_obklen == .true., now calculates obklen
          itself regardless of the eddy scheme.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/wv_saturation.F90
        - 'MurphyKoop' scheme added for new wvsat_scheme option.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/zm_conv.F90
        - Removed pcnst dependency (workaround for bug on PGI).

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/ebert_curry.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/oldcloud.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/slingo.F90
        - wavmin and wavmax are now set by accessor function.

M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/rad_solar_var.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radconstants.F90
        - Tweak to include far-IR in solar variability is now done in
          rad_solar_var rather than radconstants. (Lowest bin extends
          down to 100 microns, regardless of actual value.)
        - Accessor functions (get_sw/lw_spectral_boundaries) have
          minor improvements.

M    models/atm/cam/test/system/input_tests_master
        - Added CARMA tests.

M    models/atm/cam/bld/perl5lib/Build/ChemPreprocess.pm
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_debug_util.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/physics/waccm/gw_drag.F90
M    models/atm/cam/src/utils/cam_pio_utils.F90
        - Cosmetic changes (comments, typos, whitespace).

If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the
appropriate machine below.  All failed tests must be justified.

bluefire: all passed

edinburgh/lf95: all passed except

bl318 TBL.sh f10c4cdm sat_hist 9s

      This is an expected answer change, because satellite history
      interpolation now uses the correct great circle distance to find
      distances to columns.

edinburgh/pgi or jaguar/pgi: all passed

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations: Any with satellite history output.
- what platforms/compilers: All
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate):
        - Diagnostic output in satellite history file changes for some
          columns; this has no effect on other output, which is all
          bit for bit.

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
- MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
- what platforms/compilers:
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

	Changes to CAM-SE for which we do not yet have a standard climate.
	Changes to COSP tests due to the change in default phys_loadbalance from 0 to 2, 
	this is a bug to be investigated.   

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):
- MSS location of output:

MSS location of control simulations used to validate new climate:

One-line Summary: svn external updates, Makefile updates, testing updates

Purpose of changes:

. svn externals updated to cesm1_1_beta11 component tags.  csm_share tag had a bug
  that was caught by the lahey compiler, so the latest csm_share tag was
  needed, along with a newer esmf_wrf_timemgr and clm tags.

. Makefile.in was updated to set CPPDEF flags to specify different compilers
  in the latests csm_share tag.

. CESM tests for 2deg FAMIPC5 and T42 FC5 were added to bluefire posttag test.
  PES layouts for cesm are being overridden by the cam tests scripts.
  lrg_regular queue is being used for bluefire testing.

.  fatmgrid was removed from the namelists, now using combined grid/land
   fraction data fatmlndfrc

.  atm_id was made public in cam_instance.F90 to speed up lookups in shr_pio_mod

.  New initial condition files for ne16 and ne60

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

. Makefile.in was updated to set CPPDEF flags for the different compilers
  in the latests csm_share tag.  
    For PGI compiler       set -DCPRPGI 
    For INTEL compiler     set -DCPRINTEL 
    For Pathscale compiler set -DCPRPATHSCALE 
    For Cray compiler      set -DCPRCRAY

One-line Summary: Support for new CLM MEGAN VOC emissions

Purpose of changes:

 * New functionality for CLM MEGAN VOC emissions 
   - flexibility in specifying VOC emissions from MEGAN in CLM
 * New functionality for offline dyn driver
   - ability added to turn off surface feedbacks to climate 
     met_srf_feedback (default is false)
 * New functionality added for generating chem rate diagnostics
 * Revived broken trop_mam7 and super_fast_llnl_mam3 chem packages
 * Added new chem packages :
   - trop_mozart_mam3
   - trop_mozart_soa
   - trop_strat_mam3
 * Added ability to support chemistry species names up to 16 characters
 * Maximum length for history increased to 24 characters
 * Fixed bug in physics_buffer
 * Fixed path issues in chem perl build modules for CESM scripts
 * Chemistry preprocessor changes :
   - supports chem species names up to 16 chars
   - remove references to het specifications -- all species can have wet removal
   - carbon mass of species output
   - calculates molecular masses using double precision to get consistent masses wrt invoking 
     the preprocessor on different platforms and compilers
   - new functionality for generating chem rate diagnostics
 * Switched on TMS for SC and SD WACCM
 * Misc cleanup in chemistry routines

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

   Namelist group megan_emis_nl has been added to file drv_flds_in
	
   Namelist variables:
     megan_specifier, megan_mapped_emisfctrs, megan_factors_file
  
   megan_specifier is a series of strings where each string contains one 
    CAM chemistry constituent name (left of = sign) and one or more MEGAN 
    compounds (seperated by + sign if more than one).  The specification of 
    the MEGAN compounds to the right of the = signs tells the MEGAN VOC 
    model within CLM how to construct the VOC fluxes using the factors in 
    megan_factors_file and land surface state.
  
   megan_factors_file read by CLM contains valid MEGAN compound names,
    MEGAN class groupings and scalar emission factors
   
   megan_mapped_emisfctrs switch is used to tell the MEGAN model to use 
    mapped emission factors read in from the CLM surface data input file
    rather than the scalar factors from megan_factors_file
  
   Example:
   &megan_emis_nl
    megan_specifier = 'ISOP = isoprene',
       'C10H16 = myrcene + sabinene + limonene + carene_3 + ocimene_t_b + pinene_b + ...',
       'CH3OH = methanol',
       'C2H5OH = ethanol',
       'CH2O = formaldehyde',
       'CH3CHO = acetaldehyde',
   ...
    megan_factors_file = '$datapath/megan_emis_factors.nc'

One-line Summary: new physics buffer and  bug fixes

Purpose of changes:

- Implemented new physics buffer, this involves introduction of two new 
  modules - utils/buffer.F90.in and physics/cam/physics_buffer.F90.in
  buffer.F90.in introduces low level support for persistent arrays of types r8, r4, and i4 and
  up to 7 dimensions (the max allowed in fortran arrays).  These arrays are accessed and manipulated
  through a common (type independent) API.  
  physics_buffer.F90.in uses the low level buffer module and provides additional methods for physics.
  The physics buffer array is a derived type array declared in the cam_comp module with
  dimensions (pbufflds,begchunk:endchunk) within this structure arrays can be of type r8, r4, or i4 and
  always have first dimension pcols, all further dimensions are optional.    
  
- Moved the subroutines initindx, tphysac, and tphysbc into the physpkg
  module.  These routines are all part of the physics package driver.

- Fields from the buffer module were added to pbuf

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

- Added missing config file for waccmx tests
- Add missing coupler field Fioi_melth

Describe any changes made to build system: 

- change xlf90 to xlf95 in the AIX, Darwin, BGL, and BGP sections of the
  Makefile.in template

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: no difference

One-line Summary: COSP updates, bug fixes, svn external update

Purpose of changes:

. COSP updates.  Included changes are:
  - made several high-level namelist variables that control COSP.
    The new options are all meant to reduce cost by running with fewer
    subcolumns (10) and by only running cosp every 3rd time the radiation is
    run.  The new variables are:
    cosp_amwg
    cosp_lite
    cosp_passive
    cosp_active
    cosp_isccp
  - change the default mode from cosp_runall to cosp_amwg.  Add cosp_runall
    to the namelist so this mode can still be specified.
  - changed default for cosp_histfile_num from '2' to '1'.
  - changed sub-column outputs to avoid crashes when you specify
    outputs as 'A' on a monthly history file.  The subcolumn output is only
    on by default when explicitly requested via setting either
    cosp_lfrac_out=.true. or cosp_runall=.true.
  - made COSP compatible with fincl1lonlat -- so that you can run
    COSP and save COSP outputs locally.  including your changes to
    cam_history.F90

. The microp_driver and cldwat2m_micro modules have been refactored to
  create a three layered architecture comprised of a driver, cam physics
  interfaces, and a portable physics parameterization.  The driver is a
  thin layer which exposes the control logic very cleanly to facilitate
  supporting multiple microphysics schemes.  The portable physics
  parameterization is the algorithms from cldwatwm_micro, but with all the
  cam specific infrastructure for doing things like managing fields in the
  physics buffer and writing fields to history files removed.  The just
  mentioned cam specific functionality is the responsibility of the cam
  interface layer.

  This change is to facilitate supporting both the original MG microphysics
  scheme along with the new MG2 scheme under development.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Fixed a non-conforming use of the min intrisic function in the definesurf
  utility which some compilers didn't ignore.

One-line Summary: refactor state updates by macrop and microp drivers
                  Changes to testing, work around for mpi_rsend bug

Purpose of changes:

. Refactor the way the "state" was being used in the macrop and microp
  drivers to conform to the physics interface design.

  This refactoring results in a larger than roundoff answer change.
  Previously instead of updating state sequentially first with the macrop
  tendencies and then with microp tendencies, the two tendencies were added
  together and only one update of state was being done after the microp
  code (although local copies of state were being updated for internal use,
  and an updated local copy of state was being passed between the macrop
  and microp calculations which was quite confusing).

. Move the addfld/outfld calls for the cam4 physics version of REL, REI
  from the param_cldoptics module to stratiform.  This refactoring enables
  the cam4 physics package to be run with MG microphysics swapped in RK.

  The move from param_cldoptics to stratiform affects the sampling
  frequency of these fields because param_cldoptics_calc was only called on
  radiation timesteps while stratiform_tend is called every timestep.  So
  there will be a larger than roundoff difference in the diagnostic history
  fields.

. Changes to testing
  The namelist files used for testing had hard coded inputdata directory paths
  in them.  This was making it hard to run the tests on non NCAR systems.  The
  directory paths are no being set by the enviroment variable $CSMDATA.
  Set up pretag test to run on jaguarpf

. Work around for mpi_rsend bug
  The Gemini interconnect has a performance bug for mpi_rsend and mpi_irsend.
  CPP flag _NO_MPI_RSEND was added so that MPI_RSEND and MPI_IRSEND can be
  redefined to MPI_SEND.  _NO_MPI_RSEND is only set within the CESM scripts.

. Bug fix for addfld call for U_COSP and V_COSP.
  Should be dimension of 1 instead of pver.

One-line Summary: Functionality for prescribed MAM and diagnostic radiation calcs w/ MAM.

Purpose of changes:

The mods in this commit provide the functionality to run the cam5 physics
package with prescribed modal aerosols, and enable diagnostic radiation
calculations with modal aerosols.

*** Note that a climate validation has not yet been performed for cam5
*** using this version of prescribed modal aerosols.  Preliminary work has
*** been done at PNNL using a completely different code base.  The findings
*** from that work still need to be applied to this code base.

The new features required breaking the tight link between the code
responsible for optics/microphysics calculations and the data structures
used in the prognostic modal aerosol code.  That has been accomplished by
extending the rad_constituent interfaces to be able to provide information
about the modal aerosols.  But there a few complications related to the
interactions with the microphysics:

1) There are derived fields that are associated with the aerosol modes (the
water uptake by the mode, QAERWAT, and the mode wet radius, DGNUMWET), and
as currently implemented, these fields are only being computed for the
modes used in the climate calculations.  In the diagnostic radiation
calculations, the loop over modes is using the same values of QAERWAT and
DGNUMWET that were computed for the climate active modes.

2) The part of the droplet activation code that modifies the number and
mass mixing ratios of the modal aerosols is disabled if the aerosols that
affect the climate are prescribed.

3) The mode dry radius calculation which is a precurser to the wet radius
calculation is also where the modal aerosol physics responsible for mass
transfer between the accumulation and aitken modes takes place.  If the
modal aerosols that affect the climate calculation are prescribed, then
only a diagnostic calculation of dry radius takes place and the mode
transfer physics is disabled.

Both items 2) and 3) above imply that the prognostic modal aerosols must
affect the climate radiation calculation in order for all processes
affecting the modal aerosols to be computed.  In other words, you can't run
a full prognostic modal aerosol calculation if those aerosols are only
participating in diagnostic radiation calculations.

To summarize:

. The prescribed modal aerosol feature is fully functional.  Scientific
  validation with this code remains to be done.

. When prognostic modal aerosols are used only roundoff size differences
  have been introduced into the model results.  Most of these roundoff
  differences are at the double precision level.  But the one exception is
  that the sigma_logr_aer variable in the modal optics file was updated to
  match the hardcoded values of sigmag_amode in the modal_aero_data module,
  and this introduces a single precision roundoff error.

. The previous version of diagnostic radiation calculations with modal
  aerosols had hardcoded the restriction that no modal aerosols were
  present in any diagnostic calculation.  This restriction has been
  removed.

. The capability to do diagnostic radiation calculations with the modal
  aerosols is functional, but with the following important restriction:

  *** The derived QAERWAT and DGNUMWET fields are not recomputed for the
  *** modes used in a diagnostic calculation.

  The QAERWAT and DGNUMWET fields computed for the modes that affect the
  climate will be reused in the diagnostic calculations.  This may be an
  acceptable approximation in some cases, but not in others.  It also
  implies that there is not yet support to arbitrarily remove a mode from
  the diagnostic calculation.

. Due to the current constraint that there is only one version of the
  QAERWAT and DGNUMWET fields, a full prognostic aerosol calculation is
  only done when the prognostic aerosols are the ones that affect the
  climate.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. new variable, mode_defs, provides the metadata necessary to define the
  modes.  The default value is set by build-namelist.
. The existing namelist variables used by rad_constituents, i.e.,
  rad_climate and rad_diag_*, have been updated to accept modes as entities
  that can effect the climate and diagnostic radiation calculations.  The
  default value of rad_climate is set by build-namelist.
. The syntax of the rad_climate and rad_diag_* variables has been changed
  as follows.  The source of gas or aerosol mixing ratios was previously
  specified with either a 'P' (for prognostic) or a 'D' (for data).  But
  the real meaning of this specifier is that the mixing ratio will be found
  in either the constituent array (P) or the physics buffer (D).  However
  there is a semantic inconsistency in that prognostic species may also be
  found in the physics buffer, e.g., the cloud borne modal species.  So the
  source term has been renamed: 'P' has been changed to 'A' (for advected)
  and 'D' has been changed to 'N' (for non-advected).  Those terms are
  more physical descriptions of the difference between constituents that
  are stored in the constituent array (part of the state derived type)
  vs constituents that are stored in the physics buffer.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. The file that contained properties for all modes (modal_optics_3mode.nc)
  has been broken up into 3 files which each contain properties for a
  single mode:
    mam3_mode1_rrtmg_c110318.nc
    mam3_mode2_rrtmg_c110318.nc
    mam3_mode3_rrtmg_c110318.nc

  This change introduces a single precision roundoff error due to replacing
  the single precision values in sigma_logr_aer by a new variable, sigmag,
  which contains the double precision values to match the hardcoded data in
  the modal_aero_data module.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

. no memory change
. small performance degradation of about 3% measured on 2 nodes of bluefire
  using an FV, 2 deg, cam5 config.

List all subroutines added and what they do:

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/utils/modal_aero_calcsize.F90
. moved here from chemistry/modal_aero.
. update the interfaces to pass cam state, tend, pbuf
. modal_aero_calcsize_sub
  - this code performs chemistry specific calculations for transferring
    mass between the aitken and accumulation modes.  I don't think it makes
    sense to try and do this for the prescribed aerosol mode.  Also, in
    order to execute this code for prescribed aerosols the rad_constituent
    interfaces would need to be extended to provide a lot of chemistry
    specific information that doesn't really seem appropriate (the
    information that is currently provided in the modal_aero_rename module
    when prognostic aerosols are active).  So the part of this routine that
    doew the dry radius calculation has been extracted into a new
    subroutine.  Use a MODAL_AERO ifdef around the code that is only active
    for prognostic aerosols.
. modal_aero_calcsize_diag
  - new subroutine which contains just the dry radius calculation from
    modal_aero_calcsize_sub.  The calculation here makes use of the
    rad_constituents interfaces.

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/utils/modal_aero_wateruptake.F90
. moved here from chemistry/modal_aero.
. add init method
. make use of rad_constituent interfaces
. same code used for both prognostic and prescribed modal aerosols

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/ndrop_bam.F90
. new module for droplet nucleation code used by BAM -- Moved here from the
  microp_aero module. 

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/nucleate_ice.F90
. new module for ice nucleation code -- code for ice nucleation moved here
  from the microp_aero module.  This code is used by both BAM and MAM aerosols

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
. modify the rad_climate default to implement syntax change and extention
  for modes
. Add new code to construct the default definition of trop_mam3 modes.
  This works for both prognostic and prescribed modal aerosols.
. Modify the code that extracts physprop filenames from the rad_climate and
  rad_diag_* variables to deal with the syntax changes and the new
  mode_defs variable.  This code supports the -test and -inputdata options.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
. replace old modal_optics_file defaults by defaults for the new mode
  physprop files

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml

. remove modal_optics_file

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/aquaplanet_cam3.xml
models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/aquaplanet_cam4.xml
. update the rad_climate syntax

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/bulk_aero/aerosol_intr.F90
. general cleanup
. replace several MODAL_AERO ifdefs by runtime control.  Add control
  logicals and set them using the rad_constituent interfaces to determine
  at runtime whether modal aerosols affect the climate, and whether the
  modal aerosols are prognostic or not.  Need to know whether aerosol modes
  affect the climate so can turn on code that previously would only be on
  when the prognostic aerosol code was on, but now it may be prescribed
  modes that will be used in the mode radius and water uptake calculations.
. modify prognostic_aerosol_initialize:
  - rename aerosol_init for consistency.
  - init the dgnum and dgnumwet pbuf fields
  - call the init methods for modal_aero_calcsize and
    modal_aero_wateruptake
. aerosol_wet_intr:
  - The modal_aero_calcsize and modal_aero_wateruptake interfaces have been
    cleaned up to just pass state, ptend, pbuf.  Make associated changes in
    calling code (remove several unneeded pointers into pbuf).
  - move the calls to the calcsize and wateruptake routines outside the ifdef
    MODAL_AERO section so that they are now available for prescribed modal
    aerosols.
. aerosol_emis_intr
  - interface cleanup
  - modify calls to dust_emis_intr and progseasalts_emis_intr due to
    cleaned up interfaces in those modules

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/bulk_aero/dust_intr.F90
. pass cam import state through dust_emis_intr interface

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/bulk_aero/progseasalts_intr.F90
. pass cam import state and remove unnecessary
  MODAL_AERO ifdef from progseasalts_emis_intr interface

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/modal_aero/modal_aero_data.F90
. modify the mode type names to remove embedded blanks.
. remove data for sigmag_amode, dgnum_amode, dgnumlo_amode, dgnumhi_amode,
  rhcrystal_amode, rhdeliques_amode, and remove parameter attributes.

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/modal_aero/modal_aero_initialize_data.F90
. modify the code that's setting properties for the mode species to make
  use of the new rad_constituent interfaces.
. addfld calls for water uptake diagnostics moved to the wateruptake
  module.
. modify the mode type names to remove embedded blanks.
. set data for mode props using rad_cnst_get_mode_props.
. move setting of derived props depending on sigmag from the register to
  the init method. 

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/aer_rad_props.F90
. get info from rad_constituent interfaces to determine at runtime whether
  modal optics are required.
. modal_aero_{sw,lw} no longer need to be called from within ifdef
  MODAL_AERO conditionals.  The code inside the ifdef is where the
  restriction that all diagnostic radiation calcs would set the modal
  aerosol contributions to zero.  This restriction is removed.  There was
  also a restriction that the only bulk aerosol that could be added to the
  modes was a volcanic aerosol.  This restriction is also removed.
. add list_idx arg to calls to modal_aero_{sw,lw} -- this enables
  diagnostic rad calcs to be done with modified definitions of the modes.
. combined some unnecessarily duplicated cases for opticstype

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/microp_aero.F90
. move some of the code in this module to other modules that are
  responsible for the droplet activation and ice nucleation calculations
  for BAM and MAM.  Try to have this module be more of a control layer than
  a container for specific pieces of the microphysics calculations.
  Specifically moved alot of code to the new modules ndrop_bam and
  nucleate_ice.
. remove MODAL_AERO ifdefs.  There are now runtime
  conditionals to determine whether the modal aerosols are impacting the
  climate calculation, and whether prognostic modal aerosols are active.
. update microp_aero interfaces to pass the cam state and pbuf.
. remove unused code
. move the BAM/MAM specific code for setting aerosol number outside of
  nucleati. 
. move code for droplet activation by BAM into new ndrop_bam module
. add rad_constituent interfaces to init method to determine indices for
  specific modes/species required by the nucleation code.
. access required mode number m.r. and mode/specie mass m.r. fields using
  the rad_constituent interfaces
. microp_aero_ts
  - change name to microp_aero_run for consistency
  - use state and pbuf as dummy args rather than passing individual
    components of those structures.
  - use the rad_constituents interfaces inside the subroutine to construct
    the maerosol array rather than copying data into the aer_mmr array.
. move initialization of pbuf fields to the modules that are responsible
  for them (qqcw, dgnum, dgnumwet)
. remove error function code (derf)

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/microp_driver.F90
. remove unneeded MODAL_AERO ifdefs
. remove pbuf associations that are now done inside the microp_aero_run
  routine. 

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/modal_aer_opt.F90
. refactor to make use of the new capabilities of the rad_constituent
  interfaces to provide information about the modes rather than rely on
  information about the modes being read from the modal optics dataset.
  - Also note that the modal optics dataset has been broken up so that each
    mode is in its own dataset.  Correspondingly the mode dimension has
    been removed from several arrays since that data is now obtained from
    the rad_cnst_get_mode_props calls inside the loop over modes.
. remove the reading of the modal optics file -- this data is now accessed
  via the rad_constituent interfaces.
. enable the modal_aero_{sw,lw} routines to work for diagnostic as well as
  the climate radiation calcs.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/ndrop.F90
. general cleanup
  - remove the unused surface exchange code
  - check declarations for unused vars
  - remove the conditional checks on (lnum > 0)
  - redo ndrop interfaces to pass cam types as per physics interface
  - replace local calc of pi with physconst version, and replace hardcoded
    value of sqrt(2*pi) by computed value.
. implement rad_constituent interfaces
. add logic so that tendencies are only computed for prognostic MAM
. remove the MODAL_AERO ifdef except around the code that does the tendency
  calculations. 
. rework local arrays that were declared with a pcnst dimension, but only
  needed storage for the modal number densities and species mmr.  Use a
  local indexing scheme for those constituents.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_prop.F90
. add fields for the modal optics and properties to the physprop_type
  structure. 
. modify logic to read physprop files for modes as well as for bulk
  aerosols.
. move the reading of bulk aerosol properties into separate routine and
  only call when appropriate.
. add new method for reading modal physprop files

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/physpkg.F90
. remove unused pbuf and phys_state args from rad_cnst_init call
. replace phys_state arg by pbuf in prognostic_aerosol_initialize call
. remove some unnecessary array bounds and just pass entire phys_state array

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/rad_constituents.F90
. extensions to support modal aerosols
  - a new namelist variable, mode_defs, was added to supply metadata
    defining the modes.
  - add parsing for new mode_defs variable
  - extend parsing of rad_climate and rad_diag_* variables to include
    modes. 
  - create new internal data structures for the mode definitions and for
    mode lists which are analogous to the gas and bulk aerosol lists.
  - move the initialization of data structures that contain information
    specified in the namelist up into rad_cnst_readnl so that this info is
    available elsewhere via the rad_cnst_get_info method as early in the
    initialization process as possible.
  - generic method rad_cnst_get_info has been extended to return info about
    the mode definitions
  - rad_cnst_get_aer_mmr and rad_cnst_get_aer_props have been extended to
    return mixing ratios and props for the mode species
  - rad_cnst_get_mode_num and rad_cnst_get_mode_props have been added to
    provide the number mixing ratio and properties that are specific to
    modes.
  - removed some optional args from the get_info method for data that
    should remain private in the module.
. rad_cnst_init and init_lists -- remove unused args pbuf & phys_state

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radiation_data.F90
. use rad_constituent interfaces to access mixing ratio data -- old code
  was accessing metadata which is meant to be private in the
  rad_constituents module by extending rad_cnst_get_info, then using this
  metadata to directly access the mixing ratios in the state and pbuf
  structures.  The rad_cnst_get_gas and rad_cnst_get_aer_mmr interfaces are
  supposed to be used for this.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/stratiform.F90
. remove unused cam5 macro/micro physics code

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/tphysac.F90
. fix aerosol_emis_intr interface to make ifdef MODAL_AERO unnecessary

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/vertical_diffusion.F90
. move the initialization of the physics buffer fields tke and kvh into the
  vertical diffusion init method.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/oldcloud.F90
. cleanup -- remove some unused code

models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radiation.F90
. move the add_default calls for radiation diagnostics inside the loop over
  diagnostic calculations so that when diagnostic calculations are
  requested the output from those calculations is added to the history file.

There is a bug in PGI compiler versions earlier than 11.0 which prevent it
from compiling the new rad_constituents.F90 file.  There is no obvious
workaround for this bug, so until edinburgh gets an updated pgi the testing
will be done on one of the cray platforms.

These baseline failures are all expected due to the different answers from
cam5 w/ trop_mam3.  Two tests, bl319 and bl734 failed due the test
definitions changing and the new test wasn't defined for the baseline.  But
when the new test is added to the baseline cam5_1_11, then the failures in
those tests, as in bl320, is due to a roundoff diff in the diagnostic field
CCN3.  The simulations are actually identical.


CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers: The answers are bit for bit except for
configurations with cam5 physics and trop_mam3 chemistry.  In that case a
single precision size roundoff change was introduced, and has been
validated by the climate runs below.

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced:

One-line Summary: Implement reference pressure module.

Purpose of changes:
. The physics/chemistry parameterizations only need vertical level
  locations expressed as pressures.  In many places the hybrid coefficients
  were being used to directly compute reference pressures (assuming a
  surface reference pressure of 1e5 Pa).  Since future dycores may use
  different types of vertical coordinates we needed to remove any direct
  access to the hybrid coefficients.  A new reference pressure module
  (ref_pres) has been implemented and all direct references to the hybrid
  coefficients in the physics/chemistry code have been refactored to use
  this module.  Currently the physics is operating on the grid defined by
  the dynamics, so each dycore must supply a subroutine (in dyn_grid) which
  provides the reference pressures.  The ref_pres module calls this
  subroutine during initialization to set the reference pressures.

. Do some refactoring of the initialization sequence to move where the
  hybrid coefficients are read from dycore independent places to dycore
  dependent places.

. Update documentation in namelist_definition.xml (descriptions of
  variables and categories).

. Update test lists for bluefire

One-line Summary: CAM5.1 tuning, CAM5 default output updates, bug fixes

Purpose of changes:
. CAM5.1 2 degree tuning, new values for uwshcu_rpen and rhminl
. CAM5 default outputs added
. NEU Chemistry bug fixes
. Micro physics bug fixes from Andrew Gettelman
. Modify build-namelist to produce default FV decomposition settings
  (npr_yz).  This functionality was previously embedded in the CESM scripts
  and was not available to user's of CAM standalone scripts.
. Change dataroot for lynx testing
 

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:
. build-namelist has a new argument, -ntasks, which is used to set a
  default value for the FV decomposition.  The user can always override
  this default by explicitly setting npr_yz.

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
. uwshcu_rpen was added to the namelist for CAM5.
  Default value is 10.0
  At 2deg the value is 5.0, this changes answers
. rhminl was set the .8875 for 2deg CAM5, this changes answers

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated:

List all subroutines added and what they do:
. uwshcu_readnl was added to models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/uwshcu.F90

All results are bfb, tests failed due to changes in the inithist file - for ghgrmp and outfrq3s an additional file is 
	present which was not in the baseline.  The others failed because the variable time_bnds was corrected to 
	properly reflect the (instantaneous) bounds of the inithist file and because the nlon and wnummax variables
	were removed.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by: Edwards, Eaton

List all subroutines eliminated:
   models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/io_dist.F90
   models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/io_dist.F90	
      Obsolete functions to move distributed arrays to single processor IO.
	
	
List all subroutines added and what they do:
   two new modules added - they are data processing utilities which
   rely on both CAM and HOMME infrastructure so included here but 
   not used for normal simulations.
	  
   models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/native_mapping.F90
	Allows the creation of scrip format mapping files based on the
	homme dycore basis functions.  These are smoother than bilinear
	interpolation but may not be sign preserving.  

    models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/nctopo_util_mod.F90
	Applys hyper-viscosity smoothing to PHIS, SGH, SGH30 fields,
	writes smoothed fields to history files as PHIS_SM, SGH_SM and SGH30_SM



List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:
   models/atm/cam/test/system/nl_files/ghgrmp
	Added a third history file output with new column data format but

      Updated default topo files for ne30np4, ne60np4, ne120np4 and ne240np4 hgrids
  
      Added support for new column output method, method is triggered with namelist
      variable collect_column_output = .true.   this is an array of size 6, one for
      each history file.
	
	
   models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_history.F90
   models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_history_support.F90	
	Added an interface to interp_mod so that information about the interpolation
	method is written to the history files.
	Added an option to collect column output into a single field and 
	output using the ncol format which is defined for unstructured grids.
	This is a much faster method when you are outputing several columns
	
   models/atm/cam/src/utils/spmd_utils.F90
        Refactored in an effort to move toward removeing mpishorthand.F and
	making this the sole location in cam where mpif.h is included.

Date: Wed Mar 16 2011
One-line Summary: added functionality for fv 2.5x3.33 resolution; small fixes 
and cleanup to test scripts; added support for 0.25deg cam-homme; tweak of 
cam5 tuning parameters; bug fixes to flushing of output buffers; updated 
externals definitions for component tags

=======
Purpose of changes:
-machine jaguar was decommissioned 3/7/11 so support was stripped from test scripts
-adjusted tuning parameters dust_emis_fact and cldfrc_rhminl for cam5_1...tuning 
 was done at 1deg but applies to all resolutions for now - tuning specific to
 other resolutions may follow
-externals updated from cesm1_0_beta13 to cesm1_0_beta16

One-line Summary:  Refactoring cam history

Purpose of changes:

. Refactoring in cam history to allow for extra dimensions beyond the
  current spatial/temporal ones.  Previously the fields in a history file
  time sample only had (lon,lat,lev,time) or (ncol,lev,time) dimensions.
  The "addfld" calls allowed lev to be set to 1, plev or plevp.  To work
  around this constraint in the past optional flags were added to the
  addfld subroutine that allowed more values of lev, but this workaround
  did not provide extra dimensions.  In cases where multiple non-horizontal
  dimensions were needed, e.g., level and optical depth, or level and
  subcolumn, the technique employed was to combine multiple dimensions into
  a single mixed dimension.  We have eliminated the need to do that.
  Optional arguments have been added to the addfld subroutine which allow
  defining multiple dimensions rather than just a single "lev" dimension.

. The support for 4-byte history buffers has been removed.  This feature
  added substantial complexity to cam_history, but no demonstrated benefit.
  It also was not part of the regression testing, so we don't know whether
  it was working correctly.

. The old isccp cloudsimulator code was removed.  The latest ISCCP
  simulator is available as part of the COSP package.

One-line Summary: Fix spmd_comm namelist parameters for all dycores.

Purpose of changes: SPMD controlling namelist parameters were broken for all dycores but FV 
        by my cam5_0_25 tag. Additionally the inline documentation for the parameters in 
        spmd_dyn were also screwed up. Both of these are now fixed. This tag also continues
        the namelist refactor that defines and sets the default namelist values as module 
        data instead of using the setopts routines.

One-line Summary: Added new history capabilities 

Purpose of changes:
	
  The following capabilities were added to CAM history to help with
  comparisons to observations:
   - local time averaging
   - sampling along a specified track
	
Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

 To activate local time averaging use 'L' history averaging flag and set lcltod_start, and 
 lcltod_stop namelist variable to specify the local start and stop times (in seconds) of the
 averaging region.  For example:

   hist_avgflag_pertape = 'L'
   lcltod_start = 0
   lcltod_stop  = 3600

 To activate sampling along a specified track use the following namelists:
	
  sathist_track_infile - netcdf file that specifies the track(s) the sample along
  sathist_fincl - list of history fields to be sampled
  sathist_mfilt - number of columns output to each individual file
  sathist_hfilename_spec - specifies the output file template "%c.cam2.sat.%y-%m-%d-%s.nc"
	
List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

One-line Summary: cosp bug fixes/code improvement; cleanup of cam microphysics; 
	fix for sld configurations

Purpose of changes:
- cosp mods include:
  1) reff_cosp mods per Yuying's e-mail, described in cospsimulator_intr.F90
  2) I checked that all fields to run COSP off-line are available, and changed 
     documentation at the top of cospsimulator_intr.F90.
  3)  Jim Boyle found a problem when using cosp_nradsteps = 3:
      "The data were saved as instantaneous - the values were saved as missing.
      If there is a bug I could imagine the missing values cycling through all the 
      longitudes for a month and producing seemingly complete fields."
      This was indeed a problem -  radiation is called a number of times in a 
      single timestep (loop over chunks in physpkg.F90).  Therefore, my cosp_cnt 
      counter, which was meant to advance only as timestep advanced, was advancing 
      within a timestep.  I redid the logic in radiation.F90. cosp_cnt now has an 
      lchnk dimension... each chunk has its own counter. 

      Note: for 3), the monthly outputs from a long COSP run looked ok - I think 
      they are just sub-sampling the columns in a different way.  So 3) is really 
      an answer issue more for instantaneous forecast values, and a consistency 
      issue for monthly averages.
  4) An aside code mod not related to COSP:  I added ATMEINT addfld/outfld calls 
     in cam_diagnostics.F90, a useful diagnostic for meridional heat transport 
     calculations.  

- microphysics changes involve:
  1. Removing unnecessary passed variables and use statements for the CAM5 cloud 
     microphysics (cldwat2m_micro.F90)  [Hugh: Oct 31st Mods]
  2. Adding functionality for a logical flag called 'sub_column' to be passed to 
     the CAM5 microphysics that changes how it works, but with the flag set (false) 
     to reproduce the standard code (cldwat2m_micro.F90)

- anything using sld dycore was broken with mods in cam5_0_41, where a 
  namespace issue was addressed for coupling with cism

One-line Summary: Refactoring in rad_constituents and modal aerosol code.

Purpose of changes:  

. This is another step on the path to providing prescribed modal aerosol
  functionality. 

. The rad_constituent interfaces have been generalized to treat the climate
  and diagnostic calculations more uniformly.  The use of an optional
  argument to identify a diagnostic calc is replaced by a non-optional
  argument which is set to zero to indicate the climate calculation, and to
  1,...,N_DIAG for the diagnostic calculation.  This allows us to
  consolidate the separate code for climate and diagnostic calcs in the
  radiation driver (rrtmg only).

. Removed qqcw array from pbuf structure and replaced with individual cloud
  bourne constituant species.  Code clean up including replacing goto flow
  structures and redefining static variables as parameters.

. Add test for diagnostic rad calcs with BAM and rrtmg

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

One-line Summary: mods to compute coupler indices locally

Purpose of changes:
The coupler is being changed to not depend on hard-wired indices.  Each component 
will now compute its own indices.  The calculation of the indices will reside in 
a new module called cam_cpl_indices.F90 - that is in a new directory cpl_share 
that is shared between cpl_esmf and cpl_mct. Use of seq_flds_indices is being 
removed.

One-line Summary: Merge homme dycore development, inline history interpolation

Purpose of changes: Improve support for unstructured grids

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system: 

Describe any changes made to the namelist:  Added analysis namelist for homme dycore
	with the following variables:
	interpolate_analysis : logical array which indicates whether each history file should be interpolated to a lat/lon grid
	interp_nlat, interp_nlon : integer variables indicating the size of the lat lon grid to interpolate to
	interp_gridtype: integer indicating the type of output grid to use.
	  ! gridtype = 1       equally spaced, including poles (FV scalars output grid)
          ! gridtype = 2       Gauss grid (CAM Eulerian)
          ! gridtype = 3       equally spaced, no poles (FV staggered velocity)
        interp_type : The type of interpolation to perform, currently supported values are
	  ! interp_type = 0     Native grid high order interpolation
	  ! interp_type = 1     Bilinear interpolation

	

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:
       Inline Grid interpolation appears to require some 6-10x more time per history file than writting on the native grid,
       this feature is added as a convenience for the scientist.   If high frequency output is required, or it is required that
       the interpolation meet extraordinary quality standards, then it is recommended to
       output on the native grid and interpolate using the post processing tool provided in homme.

List all subroutines eliminated:

List all subroutines added and what they do: interp_mod.F90 provides an interface between cam_history.F90

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
- what platforms/compilers:
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?
	Failing baseline cases are due to the change in dust_intr.F90, testing shows that this was a round-off 
	change for the fv cases.   The EUL cases however were not on the same grid as the dataset, though they 
	were at the same resolution, which causes the dataset to now be interpolated and thus greater 
	than roundoff error. 

        HOMME dycore baselines are failing because the default history file is now interpolated to a latlon
	grid.  These were tested to be bfb with interpolate_analysis set to .false.

	
If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:

Tag name: cam5_0_35
Originator(s): Jerry Olson
Date: Dec 29, 2010
One-line Summary:  fixed "cam3" and "cam3/aquaplanet" to be more
                   consistent with CAM3.1 release.  Adjusted cam4
	           and cam5 aquaplanet namelist parameters.

Purpose of changes: fix cam3 and aquaplanet runs.  Added cldfrc tuning 
	            parameters to namelist.  1 minor bugfix

  List of changes to have the current "cam3" replicate CAM3.1:
    1) models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/stratiform.F90:         Remove extra cldfrc call after pcond call
    2) models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/zm_conv_intr.F90:       Shut off convective momentum transport 
    3) models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/zm_conv.F90:            Call buoyan instead of buoyan_dilute
    4) models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/cam3.xml:  cldfrc_freeze_dry set to .false.
    5) models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/cam3.xml:  
        a) tuning parameters are set back to their CAM3.1 levels
	b) orb_iyear, solar_const, GHG values all set back to CAM3.1 values

  Additional changes to have the current "cam3" aquaplanet replicate CAM3.1 aquaplanet:

    1) models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/aquaplanet_cam3.xml and
       models/atm/cam/src/control/physconst.F90: 
       modify freezing point of water from 273.15 --> 273.16
    2) copy models/csm_share/shr/shr_flux_mod.F90 to
       models/atm/cam/src/utils/cam_aqua/shr_flux_mod.F90 and modify:
        a) originally uses T rather than virtual T to compute stability functions.
           Changed back to virtual T for aqua_planet.
        b) "umin" set back to 1. from 0.5

    3) models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radlw.F90:  initialization of, "cldp", using
                                                  "ntoplw" instead of "ntopcld"

    4) models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/utils/prescribed_ozone.F90:  for unit conversion of APE ozone,
       change universal constants:

         from:
           - real(R8), parameter :: SHR_CONST_MWDAIR = 28.96623324623746_R8
           - real(r8), parameter :: molmass          = 47.9981995_r8

    5) models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/aquaplanet_cam3.xml:
        a) solar_const, GHG values set back to CAM3.1 aquaplanet levels:
  	b) orbit set to circular/equinox settings.
        c) dtime set to 5 minutes physics timestep (dtime = 150 for Eulerian dycore)

        NOTE --> All tuning parameters for cam3 aquaplanet are set to standard CAM3.1 T85
	         settings no matter the dycore or resolution.  DTIME set to 5 minutes
	         physics timestep.  User must change in namelist if other settings are
                 desired.

Tag name: cam5_0_31
Originator(s): mvr, eaton, sungsu, gettleman
Date: Mon Dec 06 2010
One-line Summary: corrected the default settings for compiler type on linux 
systems; fix to unwanted side-effect of using do_circulation_diags; mod to 
enable running cam5 physics without chemistry; default settings added for 
divergence damping and velocity diffusion as well as the number of vertical 
re-mapping timesteps per physics timestep; bug fix in shallow convection 
scheme; added a few new tests, changed the names of a few others

Purpose of changes:
The previous tag broke cam testing on the crays, where the test scripts were 
relying on default settings for compiler type...changes to Makefile.in were 
applied to address this problem

We discovered that the CAM use case files that set do_circulation_diags=.true. 
were having the undesirable side effect of writing the 3D field TH into the 
daily avg h1 file. 
	
Modifications were added to get cam5 with -chem none option to produce a 
climate 'similar' to standard cam5.  This also enabled running the homme 
dycore with cam5 physics - tests were added to exercise these. (gettleman)

Default setting added for divergence damping and velocity diffusion at 1deg 
for cam5 (was 2, now 4)

Default settings added for the number of vertical re-mapping timesteps per 
physics timestep: 2 for 0.5deg and 0.25deg and 1 otherwise

The shallow convection scheme needed a fix to prevent division by zero in 
computing cumulus top height (sungsu).

edinburgh testing will now test separate suites for lahey and pgi compilers

Scam test using cam5 will now have chemistry enabled.

Default homme testing now done at higher resolution (h30np4) on bluefire

One-line Summary: Remove dependence of modal optics calc on prognostic MAM.

Purpose of changes:

. The first step in providing a prescribed modal aerosol capability is to
  make the current prognostic MAM interact with the radiative heating
  calculation via the rad_constituents module.  This commit is just part of
  the first step; the dependence of the modal_aer_opt module on the
  prognostic MAM code has been removed.  A side effect of this refactoring
  in modal_aer_opt was an extensive code clean up including removal of the
  inactive mie code (which can be reintroduced later if desired).

  The major structural change in modal_aer_opt is to reorder the loops so
  that the loop over modes is the outermost loop.  This is in preparation
  for doing diagnostic forcing calculations in which some modes are
  excluded from having a radiative effect.  The ability to do these
  diagnostic calculations is not yet in place.
  
  The rad_constituents interface is used to access the physical properties
  and mass mixing ratios of the individual species in each mode.  The
  rad_constituents interface requires the names of the species (as stored
  in the state or physics buffer) to access properties.  The names of the
  species in each mode (which is hardcoded in the prognostic MAM code) were
  added to the modal optics data file to make them accessible for either
  prognostic or prescribed modal optics calculations.

  The existing rad_constituent interfaces used list indexes to access the
  individual aerosols.  The interface was intended to be used in a context
  where the aerosols were all considered to be bulk aerosols whose optical
  properties would be externally mixed.  But in the modal context where the
  species are internally mixed we would like to be able to access
  individual species by name.  So generic methods have been added to the
  rad_constituents interfaces that allow requesting the physical properties
  and the mass mixing ratios either by index or by name.

  The namelist setting for rad_climate was updated to include all the
  3-mode species.  This is required to use the rad_constituents interface
  to retrieve properties and mmr for all the species contributing to the
  modes.

  The species refractive indices were being read from the physprops files,
  but the species densities were hardcoded and the densities in the
  physprops files did not match the hardcoded values.  So the physprops
  files were updated to contain the hardcoded values and the prognostic MAM
  code was changed to set the densities from the files.

  The phys_prop module had been hacked to get the refractive index of water
  from the physprops files of the first aerosol, and the refractive index
  of water data was duplicated in all the aerosol species files.  Remove
  this hack and put water refractive index in it's own file.  Read the data
  in the modal_aer_opt module since that's where it's used.  Give
  modal_aer_opt its own namelist for reading the name of both the water
  refindex file and the modal optics file.

  Refactor phys_prop and rad_constituents interfaces to pass complex form
  of refractive index.

  Refactor phys_prop to read refractive index data if it's present.  Don't
  depend on MODAL_AERO cpp token which is only defined for prognostic MAM.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. rad_climate updated for trop_mam3 to include all species that contribute
  to the modes.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. The modal optics file has been updated to include the metadata that
  describes the modes, i.e., the number of species in each mode, the names
  of the species in each mode, and the types of the species in each mode.
  The original file, modal_optics_3mode.nc, was updated and renamed
  modal_optics_3mode_c100507.nc.

. The following files have the "density" variables updated to match the
  hardcoded values in the trop_mam3 code.

  bcpho_rrtmg_c090310.nc --> bcpho_rrtmg_c100508.nc
  ocpho_rrtmg_c100528.nc --> ocpho_rrtmg_c101112.nc
  ocphi_rrtmg_c080918.nc --> ocphi_rrtmg_c100508.nc
  ssam_rrtmg_c080918.nc  --> ssam_rrtmg_c100508.nc

. A new file was constructed that contains the refractive index data for
  water.  The file was created by extracting the data from
  ocpho_rrtmg_c080918.nc.  It's named water_refindex_rrtmg_c080910.nc

. remove calc_optics option - currently hardcoded to not operate
. remove miefit, fitcurv, fitcurvlin, chebft, write_modal_optics
. remove BACKSCAT which was only used for mie calcs
. remove "use mpishorthand" -- not referenced
. remove module variables nrefr, nrefi -- they're not used as variables, so
  just use the parameters prefr, prefi
. move the loop over sw bands inside modal_aero_sw
. move the call to modal_size_parameters inside modal_aero_sw.
. modal_aero_sw 
  - change args to match aer_rad_props_sw (except diagnostic capability not
    implemented yet)
  - pull some initializations outside the loop over sw bands
  - switch the order of the outer level and mode do loops putting the mode
    loop on the outside.  This causes roundoff diffs in AODABS, AODVIS,
    SSAVIS.  These are diagnostic fields that are summed over both level
    and mode, so interchanging that sum introduces a roundoff difference.
  - move the initializations of the diagnostic output outside the sw loop.
    Need to put the burden calc inside a savaervis conditional.
  - move the mode loop outside the sw band loop.  The diagnostic output
    moves outside all the loops since the arrays used for output are only
    set for the visible band.
  - replace direct use of state%q by call to rad_cnst_get_aermmr in the
    aerosol species loop
  - refactor dust aod diagnostic to look for xname_spectype='dust'
  - remove the else clause in the computation of the dustaodmode
    calculation.  This is a bug.  The calc is accumulating contributions to
    dustaodmode inside a loop over levels.  Setting the whole result to
    zero upon encountering a layer with wetvol<=1.e-40 is zeroing the
    entire accumulation over levels to that point rather than just zeroing
    the contribution from that level.
  - use rad_cnst_get_aer_props to get species densities
. modal_aero_lw::
  - change args to match aer_rad_props_lw (except diagnostic capability not
    implemented yet)
  - repeat the same refactoring that was done in modal_aero_sw to reorder
    loops and obtain the species mmr, density, and refractive index from
    the rad_constituent interfaces.
. read_modal_optics
  - modes arg removed.  Will instead set module variable ntot_amode with
    the number of modes.
  - remove all args that are just being used to set module data, and
    instead set it directly.
  - read new variables that contain the number of species in each mode, and
    the species names and types from optics file.
  - move sigma_logr_aer from local to module data so that it can be used
    instead of modal_aero_data::sigmag_amode
. add subroutine modal_aer_opt_readnl to read modal_optics_file and
  water_refindex_file.
. add new subroutine read_water_refindex and use it to set the module data
  for complex water refractive index
. remove the call to rad_cnst_get_clim_aer_prop to access water refractive
  index data
. remove unused wavelength band arguments from modal_aer_opt_init
. access species refractive index via rad_cnst_get_aer_props
. add alnsg_amode as module data that is set using the sigma_logr_aer field
  read from the modal optics file, rather than being set from the hardcoded
  values of sigmag_amode in modal_aero_data
. allocate/deallocate arrays with sizes that depend on the number of modes.
. remove ifdef MODAL_AERO -- the code is now independent of prognostic MAM

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_prop.F90
. remove reading of water refractive index.
. refindex_aer_init - get rid of the ifdef MODAL_AERO by adding checks that
  the refindex variables are present in the file before trying to read
  them.  Only allocate space if the variable is present.
. supply the complex version of the refractive index data directly rather
  than as real and imaginary parts.

	the changed namelist variable is used and produces different

	The rest of the failures were expected due to an update to the

One-line Summary: Mods for COSP; phys_grid column pair fix

Purpose of changes:

. Changes were made to configure and to the COSP source tree to enable the
  build of COSP from the CESM scripts as part of the atm library (the
  standalone CAM build builds COSP as a separate library).

. The COSP interface module was incurring an unnecessary memory overhead
  when the COSP simulator was not being used.  This has been remedied
  (fixes from Jim Edwards).

. Modify configure to remove restrictions against building for spmd or smp
  modes with Darwin OS.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Fix to column pairing algorithm in phys_grid.  From Pat Worley:
  > The error does not break the
  > code, it just erroneously disables the wrap map of the columns as
  > well as the column pairing. This essentially disables all load
  > balancing when the namelist parameter phys_twin_algorithm == 0 or
  > when using HOMME and not setting phys_twin_algorithm = 1.

One-line Summary: update/fixes made to COSP code; add a test to test_driver 
for exercising COSP; Supply a missing initialization in the reproducible sum code

Purpose of changes:  
1) additional logic so that cosp outputs that require both radar and
lidar simulator are saved only when both simulators are run
2) double counting of the convective cloud water in cosp inputs.  this
required defining some new variables for the stratiform cloud water
within cospsimulator_intr.F90.
3) Pressures and heights not defined correctly in cosp inputs.
Yuying: "Based on TYPE COSP_GRIDBOX (line 282-286) in cosp_types.F90,
zlev & p are height and pressure at model levels,
and zlev_half & ph are values at bottom (interface) of model layer.
The definition in cospsimulator_intr.F90 (line 1581-1584) shows that
gbx%p & gbx%zlev are interface values while
gbx%ph & gbx%zlev_half are at model levels."
4) convection *_flxprc are for rain+snow while stratiform *_flxprc was
for rain only.  I am changing ls_flxprc so that it includes
both rain and snow in cldwat.F90, ~ line 946, rkflx = precab instead of
rkflx = precab - snowab.  It is confusing to have things labeled
*_flxprc when some include rain and others include rain+snow.  I also
made name mods in stratiform.F90.  I modified cospsimulator.F90
accordingly -- see lines 1447 - 1469.
5) Jim wanted a namelist variable so that you can specify which CAM
history tape COSP outputs are written to
I used Jerry's mods for history_budget_histfile_num as a template.
I added cosp_histfile_num as a namelist variable by making mods to both
namelist_definition.xml and to cospsimulator_intr.F90.
6) circa line 4288, dimension name wrong --
"dimen4a(3)=cosp_prstau_modis_dim" should be
"dimen4m(3)=cosp_prstau_modis_dim"
7) for cfad_sr532_cal.  nbze_cosp = nsr_cosp = 15.  this leads to if
statement problems because cam_history.F90 only checks flags and
dimensions sizes. i set the flag_**dbze** = .false when flag_cosphtsrlev
= .true circa line 1281
8) similar problem for fisccp1_cosp and isccp simulator flags. fix circa
line 1293

Purpose of changes:  

This makes the co2vmr value used in the WACCM nlte_fomichev module 
consistent with the value in the WACCM lower boundary file.  This 
capability has been extended to non WACCM configurations so that 
a WACCM LBC file can be used set the CAM GHG surface values.

Also included is a change in the age-of-air tracers to use values 
from the initial conditions file as initial values.  To override
this default behavior set aoa_read_from_ic_file namelist variable

One-line Summary: Fix for FV div4 filter; refactor pertlim code; rcp6.0 update

Purpose of changes:

. Fixes to indices for ghost regions in FV div4 filter (from Art Mirin).

. Refactor the application of a perturbation to the initial T field so that
  it is distributed.  Previously the 3D T field was read to the master
  task and then scattered after the perturbation was applied.

. Modify the rcp6.0 use case to use the datm version of the prescribed
  aerosol deposition fluxes.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. The results of the FV dycore with the div4 filtering on (only on by
  default for 1/2 deg and higher resolution) where found to depend on the
  decomposition.  The fixes to ghost region indexing has resolved this.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: 

. change aerosol deposition dataset in use case 2005-2100_cam4_rcp60

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: 

. The change to how an initial temperature perturbation is applied
  substantially reduces memory requirements (eliminating the need for a
  global 3D field) so that perturbation growth tests may be done at higher
  resolutions.

One-line Summary: fix HOMME for repro_sum change; mods to high-res FV config; logfile output; COSP updates

Purpose of changes:

. Fix HOMME dycore to supply the new "commid" argument in the repro_sum
  calls. 

. Changes to FV filtering default for high resolution grids (1/2 deg and
  finer). 

. Modify logfile output to include lists of all history fields in the
  master and the active lists, including long_name.

. Remove the echo of the GHG and Solar forcing data to the IC file (it's
  still in the history files).  It's never read from the IC file, so it's
  confusing to have it there.

. Modify waccm_2000_cam4 use case with updated IC files.

. Makefile updates for the BGP and the Linux/Intel builds.

. Updates to COSP simulator code:
  - fix mpi bug
  - output cosp coordinate values in variables rather than as attributes
  - output cosp coordinate bounds in CF compliant variables rather than as
    attributes 
  - mods to save COSP CFMIP outputs with different frequencies on separate
    history files.

. Modify pretag tests for HOMME on bluefire

The failed test sm731 of HOMME in hybrid mode appears to be a system
problem.  It is only when the executable is built with threads enabled that
the failure occurs.  The error message points to the following location:

Illegal instruction (privileged operation) in cam_history.__cam_history_NMOD__&&_cam_history.__cam_history_NMOD_h_define at line 3350 in file "/ptmp/eaton/src/cam5_0_12_trb/models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_history.F90" ($t1)
 3350         if(restart) then

I'm guessing that the illegal instruction message is a result of the
variable "restart" being corrupted.  This configuration runs successfully
under PGI on edinburgh.  On bluefire the configuration runs successfully if
the debug flags are removed.  It also runs successfully with debug in
serial and pure mpi modes.  The code fails in a pure OMP mode in with an
identical error message as above.  Running a debug/OMP executable in
totalview with memoryscape enabled is successful, apparently due to
totalview's control of memory management.  When run in totalview without
memory tracing enabled the reported error is the same as above.  The
reported error is not in a threaded code region.  I added a pure mpi
version of the test so that HOMME would continue to be tested, and left
just the smoke test version of the debug/hybrid configuration that's
failing to keep this problem on the radar.

experiments.
This default logical is set in cospsimulator_intr.F90
Default: FALSE

cfmip_da:
If true, the COSP cloud simulator is run for CFMIP daily 
experiments.

ncolumns:
Number of subcolumns in SCOPS
This default logical is set in cospsimulator_intr.F90
Default: 50

Path for the Atrain orbit data file provided by CFMIP.
There is no default for this, but sample_atrain = .true. will not work 
if this namelist variable is undefined.
currently /project/cms/jenkay/SCAM/repository/cloudsat_orbit_08921_14250.nc

models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_history.F90
. add output for cosp simulator -- the main issue is all the new level
  dimensions and coordinate variables 
. remove the call to check_accum from subroutine hbuf_accum_inst.  This
  subroutine checks that either all values in a column are fill values, or
  none are.  This breaks when the vertical dimension is actually a
  collection of subcolumns (stacked on top of one another) some of which
  contain fill values and others which don't.  An assumption of the
  accumulator for time averaging is that a column (the vertical dimension)
  is all fill value or no fill value.  These hybrid vertical dimensions
  break that assumption.  As a consequence they should only be output as
  instantaneous fields.
. Don't call the h_normalize subroutine for instantaneous fields.  For
  fields with fill values it enforces the constraint that either all values
  in the vertical dimension are the fill value, or none are.  This is not
  true for cosp output.  It should be up to the diagnostic code to enforce
  this constraint where it is appropriate, not the generic h_normalize
  code.

One-line Summary: FV memory optimization; repro_sum update; spmd_utils and mod_comm communication protocol updates.

Purpose of changes: 

. significant decrease in memory requirements in FV mod_comm

. modification to implementation of handshaking communication 
  logic in spmd_utils and mod_comm to improve robustness. 
  Problems have not been observed with previous implementation,
  and these changes are simply to avoid potential future problems.

. modification to repro_sum logic, improving accuracy in extreme
  cases, enabling bit-for-bit agreement whether using 4-byte or 
  8-byte integers in implementation, and changing CPP token used 
  to determine which length integers to use

. modification to repro_sum implementation to remove 
  dependencies in mpishorthand, spmd_utils, cam_iulog,
  and abortutils, as first step to moving repro_sum_mod to
  models/csm_share or models/utils (for use by other components)

One-line Summary:Fixed CAM memory leak with work-around for xlf90 compiler bad code generation bug(IBM PMR 21571.003.000)

Purpose of changes: Fixed memory leak in CAM by adding a work-around to CAM for a bad code generation bug in IBM's xlf90 comipler. 

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
. Fix memory leak in CAM caused by IBM xlf90 compiler error which does not free memory for an automatic array (which is the return value for an called function)  before the calling function exits. The calling function is pbuf_get_fld_idx.  When the calling function is exited memory for the automatic array is not freed - and is never freed.  Diane submitted a failing testcase to IBM and they filed IBM internal bug report PMR 21571.003.000.   

. Fixed misplaced t_startf call in aircraft_emit.F90 which results in mismatched timer calls when aircraft_emit.F90 results in mismatched timer calls when aircraft emission code isn't active.  (Also removed embedded space from teh event tag).

This modication removes a check (call to to_upper from inside an if-block that contains a return statement within the if-block)  that caused a memory leak, due to a bug in the IBM xlf90 compiler (see IBM bug report PMR 21571.003.000).   

./models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/stratiform.F90

Made pbuf_get_fld_idx calls case sensitive by using arguments with the same case for field name that was used to create the pbuf entry. 
ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('KVH') was changed to ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('kvh')
ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('TKE') was changed to ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('tke') 
ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('TURBTYPE') was changed to ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('turbtype') 
ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('SMAW') was changed to ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('smaw')  
 
./models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/tphysac.F90 

Made pbuf_get_fld_idx call case sensitive by using argument with the same case for field name that was used to create the pbuf entry. 
ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('KVH') was chaned to ifld = pbuf_get_fld_idx('kvh')

 parallel IO utilities.  

 Fix a bug in the CAM configure utility to allow the user to customize
 the  trop_bam, trop_ghg, and waccm_ghg chemistry packages via the "-usr_mech_infile" 
 configure option.

 Removed the "prog_species" specification to allow the user to customize
 the chemical mechanism.  The prog_species specification is not needed
 here since these chemistry packages are pre-defined, i.e., the preprocessor
 generated source code for the chem packages are already included in the 
 standard source code distribution.

M   models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
 Adjustments needed for trop_bam, trop_ghg, and waccm_ghg since prog_species
 is not set for these chem packages. 
 Included the ver=>'fixed_ox' specification to tracer_cnst* default namelist 
 settings.

One-line Summary: various fixes made to test scripts; pnetcdf bug fix and 
io cleanup from release branch

Purpose of changes: 
The test scripts place an explicit call to generate_cice_decomp.pl (the cice 
decomposition script) so that cice can be built in a manner that allows reuse 
of the resulting binary during restart tests, where the number of mpi tasks 
(and possible smp threads) are changed.  Until now, this script was not being 
called with the proper inputs, but still managed to provide an executable 
that could be reused for restart tests.  

However, we discovered that this was the cause of a failed test in the jaguar 
posttag testing, where the pgi compiler had a problem with zero-length arrays 
being created as a by-product.  To fix that problem, changes were made to properly 
call the decomp script and make the necessary changes to the rest of the test 
scripts to deal with some of its constraints.  For example, testing on bluefire 
was moved to 48 processors (under-utilizing one bluefire node) because many of its 
tests are done at fv 4x5, which does not have a cartesian solution with 64 procs.

This is viewed as a short-term solution.  Long-term we intend to remove the call 
to generate_cice_decomp.pl from the test scripts and have cam's configure figure 
out the parameters to send to the cice build.

One-line Summary: code workaround for bluefire threading problem; update externals

Purpose of changes:

. A system problem on bluefire has been causing threaded CAM runs to either
  crash badly (bringing down the node) when running cam5, or just seg fault
  when running with cam4.  A code modification has been made in the
  tropopause module which allows cam4 to run without seg faulting, but does
  not fix the problem running cam5.  A firmware fix for bluefire will be
  applied shortly, and at that time we may back out this workaround.

. Update to cesm1_0_beta05 externals.

Purpose of changes:

. The change to the restart file made in cam4_9_11 which moved the variable
  rst_calendar to a global attribute has been backed out.  The change is
  not backwards compatible with older restart files which prevents the
  model from doing branch runs from older ccsm4 runs.

One-line Summary: update externals; build-namelist mod for cam5; change
  adiabatic mode dry mass; fix cam5 budget output; cleanup for release

Purpose of changes:

. update externals to be consistent with cesm1_0_beta03

. modify build-namelist to call the cice build-namelist with cam5=.true. for
  cam5 runs.  This enables the cice build-namelist to provide the following
  cam5 specific settings: r_snw=1.75, dt_mlt_in=1.0, rsnw_melt_in=1000.
  Note that these changes were already in place for runs using the ccsm
  scripts. 

. updates to namelist defaults for HOMME (from Mark Taylor)

. new run script template for scam (from John Truesdale)

. updates to aquaplanet use case (from John Truesdale)

. change how the dry atmosphere mass is fixed in adiabatic mode (from
  Christianne Jablonowski)

. cleanup comments in stratiform (from Andrew Gettelman)

. add missing CAM5 budget diagnostics (from Jerry Olson)

. remove unsupported KE deep convection scheme

. remove unsupported water tracer code

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

. fix bug in creation of cam.buildexe.csh (wouldn't allow switching between
  mct and esmf interfaces after the script was created)  This is only
  relevent to running with ccsm scripts.  (from Tony Craig)

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. modify the atm_dep_flux namelist variable so that setting it to false
  explicitly sets the deposition fluxes sent to the coupler to zero.
  Previously setting it to false was supposed to signal to CLM and CICE to
  read the deposition fluxes from an external file.  But that functionality
  has been removed from CICE, and both CLM and CICE now expect CAM to
  always provide these fluxes.  Explicitly setting them to zero provides a
  way to turn of the climate feedbacks from prognostically determined
  fluxes.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: 

. update the 20th century use cases to use the 1850-2008 AMIP SST datasets
  rather than 1850 climatology.  (This affects CAM standalone runs only,
  not runs done using ccsm scripts.)

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: not checked

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated:

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/convect_ke.F90
models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/convect_ke_intr.F90

The baseline failures are due to the following:
. The bugfix to snow hydrology in CLM changes answers in all configurations
  that use CLM.
. The update to build-namelist changes answers for all configurations using
  CAM5 physics and CICE due to changed parameter values.
. The update to how the dry mass is initialized in adiabatic mode causes
  answer changes in all adiabatic tests.
. The update to use the AMIP SST datasets for all transient tests changes
  answers in runs using the 1850-2005 use cases.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
- what platforms/compilers:
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): 

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- source tag (all code used must be in the repository):
- platform/compilers:
- configure commandline:
- build-namelist command (or complete namelist):

One-line Summary: mods for BGC runs; mods to super_fast_llnl use cases;
 misc cleanup

Purpose of changes:

. Add logic to build-namelist for the desired co2_cycle behavior: 
  If co2_cycle is true then:
  - don't read the co2 fossil fuel fluxes when sim_year=1850
  - read the co2 fossil fuel fluxes when sim_year=1850-2000 unless the user
    explicitly sets co2_readflux_fuel=.false.
  - make the prognostic CO2 radiatively active unless the user explicitly
    sets co2_cycle_rad_passive=.true.

. mods for output when co2_cycle is active
. mods in super_fast_llnl use cases
. make the setting of npr_yz in the cam.buildnml.csh script more robust 
. remove the compiler patch args from the AIX section.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: none

One-line Summary: Added aquaplanet as component model and make docn default for cam

Purpose of changes: aquaplanet is now a supported configuration.  It is no longer
	a namelist option but is now an -ocn aquaplanet option to the configure script.  
	The configure -ocn aquaplanet and build-namelist calls will produce a cam 
	executable that uses the default analytic sst pattern #1.  I also included two 
	new use cases that allow building namelists which have specific settings for the
	ape experiments (resetting of model constants, special boundary datasets, etc.)
	There is a use case for cam3/cam4 called aquaplanet_cam3_cam4 and one for cam5
	physics called aquaplanet_cam5.  The cam3/cam4 use-case turns off aerosol forcing
	and the cam5 use-case uses most of the cam5 default configuration which includes
	prognostic aerosols.

	DOCN is now the default ocn component for CAM.  DOM is still an option to configure.
	The DOCN model uses a slightly different interpolation algorithm and is roundoff 
	compared to DOM. 

	Cleaned up the use of shr_const in the model.  Replace most of the shr_const parameters
	with their physconst analogs.  This allows a consistent use and derivation of physical 
	constants for when running aquaplanet experiments.
	
Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:
	
        DOCN is the new default ocn component
	DOM must now be specified via -ocn dom setting of configure
	aquaplanet is now an configure option -ocn aquaplanet

One-line Summary: updated the physics with code from the cam5 development branch; 
some changes to the dynamics, including the enabling of fourth-order divergence damping

Purpose of changes:

Devlopment of the cam5 physics has been occuring on a code branch for some 
time.  The merge of that code base with that of the cam trunk is now complete, 
including backwards compatibility with cam4 and cam3 physics.  For more details 
on the changes, see the ChangeLog file for the branch camdev_cam3_6_23.

There were some changes to the dynamics included with this merge including:
- Switch to enable fourth-order divergence damping except at the model top layers where regular 
  second-order (Laplacian) damping is applied (damps both divergence and vorticity).
- FV no longer writes/reads "DELP" to/from IC file.
- Added another nested loop to the FV dynamical core.  allow multiple vertical 
  remappings within a physics time-step.  added new namelist variable:  NSPLTVRM (for 
  split vertical remapping) as an addtion to the NSPLIT and NSPLTRAC dynamics  
  splitting namelist variables.  Default is 1.

  is no longer being read from the initial conditions file, or both (this was not investigated)
	
CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers:
cam5:  answers change due to new climate 
cam4:  the change to no longer read delp from the initial file may produce answers beyond round-off; the change 
       to the setting of the condensate-to-rain autoconversion coefficient (c0) from a scalar to a computation 
       introduces a round-off level difference on some compilers (for example, edinburgh w/pgi and w/lahey)
	
If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?
- cam5 answere are b4b with end of the development branch - see the ChangeLog file for branch camdev_cam3_6_23 for 
  validation details
	
If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,
- see the ChangeLog file for branch camdev_cam3_6_23 for validation details

One-line Summary: Correction to the solar spectral scaling in CAMRT used by WACCM.

Purpose of changes:

 Corrected solar band spectral scaling in CAMRT used in WACCM 
 and super_fast_llnl simulations.  Added history fields for 
 off-line radiation calculations.  Band-level scaling is now
 computed relative to a reference spectrum of 4 solar cycles
 rather than a reference from the CAMRT code.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

   Namelist variable "solar_htng_spctrl_scl" added.  This is a switch that can be used to
   turn on/off the solar band spectral heating.  This is set to TRUE by default for waccm_mozart 
   or when radiation package is RRTMG, otherwise it is set to FALSE

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: none

List all subroutines added and what they do:

A       models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/rad_solar_var.F90
  Manages the solar spectral scaling specific to RRTMG radiation package.
  This is the same as the previous version, just moved to the rrtmg directory.
  Band level scaling in RRTMG continues to be relative to the base Kurucz
  spectrum assumed by RRTMG.

One-line Summary: update for carbon cycle runs

Purpose of changes:

. Updates to configure and build-namelist to facilitate "out of the box"
  capability for carbon cycle runs.  When the configure option -co2_cycle
  is set, build-namelist will by default set the flags to turn on the
  co2_cycle code in CAM (adds 4 tracers) and will set the flag to read the
  fossil fuel emissions dataset.  Note that the code that reads the
  emission dataset doesn't do any spatial interpolation.  We currently only
  have the required dataset at fv 0.9x1.25 resolution.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. add default fossil fuel emissions dataset:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: none

List all subroutines added and what they do: none

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. remove the check that only allows the -co2_cycle option to be specified
  with -ccsm_seq.  This option can be run in standalone mode to test the
  emission and flux datasets.

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
. add section to set defaults for co2_flag, co2_readflux_fuel, and
  co2flux_fuel_file when co2_cycle is true.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
. add default for co2flux_fuel_file

One-line Summary: add rcp26 and rcp45 use cases; change default fields on
  initial file; misc cleanup

Purpose of changes:

. Add use cases for rcp2.6 and rcp4.5 runs.

. Change default value of inithist_all to .false..  This affects the
  writing of extra fields to the initial file that are used in CAPT
  experiments.

. Change some defaults in the FV communications per recommendation of Pat
  Worley. 

. Misc cleanup.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Fix build-namelist deal correctly with the case when both -ignore_ic_year
  and -ignore_ic_date are specified.  You now get the -ignore_ic_date
  behavior from this setting.  This fix was needed for ncdata.  It was
  implemented correctly for finidat (used by cam standalone).

One-line Summary: add dust tuning param to namelist; misc configure/build-namelist mods

Purpose of changes:

. Make the dust emission tuning parameter namelist accessable.

. Modify the dust emission tuning parameter for trop_bam only.

. Remove any remaining references to track1 from the CAM regression
  tests. 

. The CLM deposition velocity calc is a runtime setting.  Remove the switch 
  from configure and require it to be set via build-namelist.

. Add error trapping in build-namelist to protect against the user setting
  tms_orocnst without setting do_tms.

One-line Summary: update externals; update rcp8.5 use case

Purpose of changes:

. update externals to match ccsm4_0_beta45

. update the solar and ghg files in the rcp8.5 use case

. Move the pilgrim directory location so that CCSM tags don't need to
  explicitly declare pilgrim to be an external.  It will now automatically
  come with the declared CAM tag.  Since pilgrim is maintained as part of
  CAM, this change enforces the consistency between pilgrim and CAM tags
  that is already implicitly assumed by the development process.

. misc cleanup

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. There was a bug in share code that caused incorrect interpolation of
  annual cycle datasets when the model start date was 101.  This code was
  only being used by CICE in prescribed mode for the interpolation of ice
  fraction.  CAM inherited the fix by updating the share external.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. CLM datasets updated with the new external.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

===============================================================

Tag name: cam4_1_00
Originator(s): eaton
Date: Wed Feb  3 10:35:05 MST 2010
One-line Summary: update names to reflect CAM4 release; update trop_bam dust; SST datasets.

Purpose of changes:

. The decision was made to publicly release what we have been calling
  track1 or cam3_5_1 during the development process as CAM-4.0.  This
  update is mainly to make name changes that are consistent with that
  decision.

  The default physics on the trunk is still in an intermediate development
  state between cam4 and the new track5 physics.  For that reason the trunk
  tag name has been advanced beyond cam4_0_00.  We expect to merge the
  track5 development branch to the trunk in the near future.

  In the public release of CAM-4.0 the cam4 physics will obviously be the
  default.  But to get cam4 physics from a trunk tag you must give the
  argument "-phys cam4" to configure.  For backwards compatibility with
  existing scripts configure will continue to recognize the value cam3_5_1
  as an alias for cam4.

. Update SST datasets for 1850 climatology and add 1850-2008 AMIP.

. Changes for dust in trop_bam
  - Update soil_erod files for 1, 1/2, and 1/4 degree FV
  - New use case: 1850_cam4_trop_bam
  - tuning mod in dust_emis_intr

. Add workaround to Makefile for problems with track5 physics on bluefire.
  This workaround causes a roundoff level change in other configurations.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. updated soil_erod files for 1, 1/2, and 1/4 degree FV

. updated the "clim_pi" SST datasets which are used when sim_year=1850.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

. update soil_erod files for 1, 1/2, and 1/4 degree FV

models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in

bl314 and bl336 fail due to the workaround in radsw for the SOLIN
calculation.  It's only the diagnostic field SOLIN that contains roundoff
level diffs.

All baselines above fail because they
use the CAM-RT radiation code which
uses the calc_col_mean routine to compute a value of both O2 and CO2.
Changing the weights used in the calculation results in a roundoff level
change if the constituent has a constant mmr to begin with, and a larger
than roundoff change in any constituent that is not already constant in the
column.  That causes larger than roundoff diffs in WACCM runs that have
prognostic CO2 and O2.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers: BFB except configs that use CAM-RT.  That
config changes by rounoff if O2 and CO2 are constant, and by more than
roundoff if O2 or CO2 have 3D variation.

One-line Summary: Support for DOCN; mods for running with CCSM scripts; misc fixes and cleanup.

Purpose of changes:

. Changes to allow running the DOCN data model in place of CAM-DOM.
  CAM-DOM is currently still the default when running in a standalone CAM
  mode (DOCN doesn't yet support the aqua-planet SSTs).  But only DOCN is
  supported for running F compsets with the CCSM scripts.

. Mod to allow putting namelist variables in the file
  $CASEROOT/SourceMods/src.cam/user_nl when running with CCSM scripts.
  This is an easier way to modify namelist settings than via the
  CAM_NAMELIST_OPTS attribute in the compset definition.

. Add ESMF interfaces and support for running with an external ESMF library
  via the CCSM scripts.

. Changes to support running single column mode from the CCSM scripts.

. Code cleanup -- added implicit none, private, and save statements to
  modules that were missing them.

. Fix bugs that were causing problems on BG/P.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. bug 1073 -- change the first argument of mpi_get_processor_name from char
  array to string.

. bug 1074 -- Add error return arg to mpi_abort.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
. Modify so that build-namelist doesn't try to find defaults for bndtvs when
  ocn has been set to none.  This was causing a problem trying to run HOMME
  from the CCSM scripts.
. Add code to write the files that docn needs.

models/atm/cam/bld/cam.cpl7.template
. Add support for "PTS_MODE" == single_column
. change use of ATM_NY -- now it's resolved at build time rather than
  configure time.
. mod to allow the user to put a file with namelist settings in the source
  mods directory in a file named user_nl, i.e.,
  $CASEROOT/SourceMods/src.cam/user_nl.  This file should have the
  format of a file that is supplied to build-namelist via the -infile
  argument. 

models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. Remove the -esmf_libvers option.  The cpp macro ESMF_v2 has been replaced
  by USE_ESMF_LIB for consistency with CCSM.  We assume that whenever an
  external ESMF lib is used, that its version is 3.1 or later.  If an
  external ESMF lib is not used, the default WRF implementation of the ESMF
  time manager utilities has interfaces from ESMF version 2.
  Modify configure to recognize the USE_ESMF_LIB environment variable which
  is set by the CCSM scripts.  This must be used to determine whether or
  not and external lib is being used since ESMF_LIBDIR is always set by the
  CCSM scripts whether it will be used or not.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
. Remove the years from the ic_ymd attributes for the finidat files.  This
  way they will be used with the default 101 start date without the user
  having to specify -ignore_ic_year to build-namelist.  This is the way
  CAM's ncdata files work as well.

One-line Summary: Update chemistry code with track5 branch code

Purpose of changes:

 - Update trunk with latest chemistry code which is in the track5 branch.
 - Eliminate the discrepancies in chem code between trunk and track5 branch.
 - Fix the super_fast_llnl build-namelist use cases.

 The changes merged in from track5 branch:
   - added capability to specify 'INTERP_MISSING_MONTHS' to the surface and elevated emissions codes  
   - modifications needed for running super_fast_llnl chemistry with prognostic modal aerosols
   - radiation packages camrt and rrtmg both have the ability to use spectral solar variance
   - chemistry photolysis reactions and radiation heating use the same input dataset
     so in chemistry configurations rad heating will have spectral solar variance
   - woods and neckel schemes of using F10.7 data to model the solar spectrum is removed
   - additional chemistry code changes:
     . use tropopause level determined by physics/cam/tropopause.F90
     . unified "users" reaction labeling scheme for waccm and cam-chem
     . aircraft sources optional
     . minimum mixing ratio of all chemical tracers greater than zero

One-line Summary: update prescribed GHG data; update externals; misc fixes

Purpose of changes:

. update external references to be consistent with ccsm4_0_beta37

. Add new timer events for performance evaluation.

. Modify physics buffer error checking in pbuf_add to be consistent with
  code in pbuf_get_fld_idx.  The physics buffer names are assumed to be
  case insensitive.

. Modify code in the parcel_dilute subroutine of zm_conv.F90 to avoid bug
  in cases where the model top is below 40 mb.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. The values of atm_nx and atm_ny were not being set correctly in the
  driver infobuffer for the HOMME dycore.

. The interpic_new Makefile had a bug in the logic for setting netcdf
  default locations.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: 

. add new IC file for T31 valid at Jan 01.

. update the prescribed GHG data for AR5 20th century runs.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: none

List all subroutines added and what they do: none

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
. Add T31 IC file for Jan 01.
. update bndtvghg to use atm/cam/ggas/ghg_hist_1765-2005_c091218.nc
. update the 1.9x2.5 fsurdat and fpftdyn files.  Last time I tried this I

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/1850-2005_track1.xml
. update bndtvghg to use atm/cam/ggas/ghg_hist_1765-2005_c091218.nc

models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/atm_comp_mct.F90
. set atm_nx and atm_ny values in infobuffer by using the dyn_grid method
  get_horiz_grid_dim_d.  Remove reference to pmgrid which should not appear
  outside of the dynamics.

models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/stepon.F90
. bugfix from Mark Taylor

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/ghg_data.F90
. fixed comment

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_buffer.F90
. modify the pbuf_add error checking for a name that's already been defined
  by making the name matching case insensitive.  The code that returns the
  buffer index for a specified name is doing case insensitive matching, so
  pbuf_add needs to be consistent with that.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/tphysac.F90
. add timer events for rayleigh friction and aerosol drydep

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radiation.F90
models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radiation.F90
. modify timer events for consistency between rrtmg and camrt code, and to
  separate out the cost of the aerosol optics calc.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/zm_conv.F90
. modify code in parcel_dilute to avoid bug in cases where the model top is
  below 40 mb.

models/atm/cam/tools/interpic_new/Makefile
. fix bug in logic for setting defaults of netcdf lib and inc dirs.

Most of the baseline failures appear to be due to a roundoff level change
introduced into either CLM or CICE.  For resolutions except FV 1.9x2.5 the
diffs don't show up at nstep=0, but are first present at nstep=3.  For the 2
degree FV runs the diffs show up at nstep=0 but just in a few fields, and
the diffs again appear to be roundoff level changes.  I suspect this is due
to updating the 2 degree CLM fsurdat file.

In addition to the differences just mentioned:

bl731 fails due to a homme bug fix.

bl112, bl132, bl312, bl332, bl387 fail due to updating the prescribed GHG
dataset.

One-line Summary: fix memory leaks

Purpose of changes:

. fix memory leaks and EUL OMP bug (see below)

. misc configure/Makefile changes:
  - enable building HOMME from CCSM scripts
  - add flexibility to deal with new dycores in set_horiz_grid method
  - remove Switch module from configure due to strange behavior on bluefire

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. memory leaks (pointed out by Chuck Bardeen) due to missing deallocation
  of allocated local variables in:
  models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/utils/tracer_data.F90
  models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/dyn_comp.F90
  models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/polar_avg.F90

. fix OMP directive in eulerian dycore (missing private variable
  declaration) (from Pat Worley)

. remove --pca from lf95 debug flags.  Documentation says it overrides the
  effect of --chk a
. remove -DCAM from the CPPDEF macro.  It is only used by HOMME, so is
  added to the USER_CPPDEFS by configure.

models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. Remove check for smp=off when building for scam.  Should run with threads
  enabled even if they aren't kept busy.
. fix set_horiz_grid so that the fv grid recognition is specific to 'fv',
  to allow extension to other dycores that start with fv, like fvcubed.
. add "-DCAM" to the cppdefs for the homme dycore.  It is the only
  component using this macro.  Having configure set the macro means that it
  will be available when running from the CCSM scripts as well as from CAM
  standalone scripts.
. remove use of Switch module.  We ran into some bizzare problems on
  bluefire.  The if/elsif conditional is just as easy to read.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml

One-line Summary: tuning for 1.9x2.5 track1 runs

Purpose of changes:

. The default value of rhminl was changed to 0.91, and a multiplier for the
  ice fall velocity in pkg_cld_sediment.F90 was set to 0.5.  Because this
  multiplier depends both on resolution and the physics/chemistry packages
  it was made settable via the namelist.

  These mods only change answers for FV 1.9x2.5 (a.k.a. 2 deg) track1 runs.
  The changes were made so that the tunings for that configuration match
  the ones used in WACCM runs.

. The WACCM use case waccm_1850_track1 was updated to be consistent with
  the prescribed aerosol changes made in the 1850_track1 use case in the
  previous tag.  This will change WACCM answers for runs using that use
  case for all horizontal resolutions except 0.9x1.25.

One-line Summary: Add output for CCR diagnostics, and to verify forcings
  for 20th century track1 runs.

Purpose of changes:

. Add diagnostic fields needed by the CCR package and for verifying that
  the intended forcings have been used in the track1 20th century
  simulations.
  - The scalar GHG and solar const values were added to history output.
    co2vmr was already there.  The values n2ovmr, ch4vmr, f11vmr, f12vmr,
    sol_tsi have been added to all history files.
  - PRECT was added by default to monthly avg output.
  - The aerosol optical depths (visible) of all species affecting the
    climate have been added by default to the monthly avg output.
  - The ability to output the column burdens of all aerosol and gas species
    that affect the climate was added.  The burdens of SO4 and O3 have been
    added to the default monthly avg file (via fincl1) for the
    1850-2005_track1 use case.  

. Modify regression tests to improve coverage of the production 1850_track1
  and 1850-2005_track1 use cases.

. Mod to configure needed for building for BGL and BGP from CCSM scripts.

. Mods to PGI settings in Makefile.in for consistency with CCSM scripts.

The above baseline failures are all due to removing the hardcoded GHG
values from the chem_surfvals module and requiring that these values be set
via the namelist.  The failed tests were all making use of the hardcoded
value of co2vmr, and that value changed when the default came from the
namelist.

were using the hardcoded GHG values in chem_surfvals.

 - fix needed to customize chemistry mechanism without dust and sea salt
 - fix needed to get troposphere level with customized chemistry mech without
   prognostic ozone present
 - cleaned up physics/cam/chemistry.F90 -- removed deprecated chemistry code
 - cleaned up aerosol_drydep_intr interface -- removed MODAL_AERO cpp def
 - fix in waccm ctem module for cases where more processors are 
   operating on physics than on dynamics

One-line Summary: spectral Eulerian dycore performance optimizations; 
T341 support; new repro_sum option

Purpose of changes: Improve performance of spectral Eulerian dycore when
have exhausted MPI parallelism; introduce new, cheaper, reproducible sum 
option; add support for T341 resolution

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system: 

* added OUTER_OMP cpp token to revert to original implementation of 
  OpenMP in spectral Eulerian dycore

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

* added phys_twin_algorithm to cam_inparm to specify whether to use
  twin algorithm in creating physics chunks (potentially overriding default)
	
* added repro_sum_use_ddpdd in cam_inparm to select alternative 
  reproducible sum algorithm

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

* Can improve performance of spectral Eulerian dycore significantly (~2x) 
  on systems with OpenMP parallelism when using large MPI process counts

* Can degrade performance of spectral Eulerian dycore slightly on systems 
  with OpenMP parallelism when using small MPI process counts. Adding
  OUTER_OMP to cpp tokens when compiling will restore original performance

Code reviewed by: self

List all subroutines eliminated:

* usetlbuf in cam/src/control/usetlbuf.c
  call to the routine was eliminated in cam3_4_04. Eliminating file now.

List all subroutines added and what they do:

* fc_gathervc in cam/src/utils/spmd_utils.F90
  flow control gather for character strings

* repro_sum_ddpdd and DDPDD in cam/src/utils/repro_sum_mod.F90
  He and Ding's implementation of the double-double reproducible sum 
  algorithm

* x86_fix_start and x86_fix_end in cam/src/utils/repro_sum_x86.c
  routines to set and restore round-to-double flag in the control word
  of a x86 fpu (required for double-double algorithm)
	
List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

1) The primary performance optimization has been moving OpenMP off of the loops
that are also decomposed with MPI and onto inner loops. Some of these loops
have also been restructured to improve the effectiveness of the OpenMP 
parallelism. Legacy Cray vectorization and streaming directives were also
removed during this process.

grids. Setting phys_twin_algorithm=.true. will force the twin algorithm to be
used. Setting phys_twin_algorithm=.false. will disable the twin algorithm.
Also added namelist support for the DDPDD alternative reproducible
sum algorithm. Setting repro_sum_use_ddpdd=.true. will enable this option.

Date: Thu Sep  3 11:44:33 MDT 2009
One-line Summary: Update externals; add cloud fraction tuning parameters to namelist.

Purpose of changes:

. Update externals to be consistent with ccsm4_0_beta22:
  cice4_0_20090805 --> cice4_0_20090831
  clm3_6_47        --> clm3_6_51
  drvseq3_0_24     --> drvseq3_0_29
  share3_090706b   --> share3_090825
  scripts4_090722b --> scripts4_090901a

. Move the cloud fraction tuning parameters rhminl, rhminh to the
  namelist.  The code that previously set these parameters in cldfrc_init
  has been replaced by entries in the namelist_defaults_cam.xml file.  The
  logic for supported tunings has been simplified by making use of the
  high level physics package attribute.  So now the default settings are
  available for the track1 and track5 physics packages (corresponding to
  the -phys values cam3_5_1 and cam), and some chemistry packages.  And of
  course the tunings remain resolution dependent.

  Most importantly, when experimenting with tunings for any particular
  model configuration, the user only needs to add values to the namelist
  input rather than having to wade through the quagmire of default settings
  in cldfrc_init in order to modify the source code.

. Modify build-namelist to allow the definition, defaults, and use case
  files to be located in the user source directories (specified via the
  -usr_src argument to configure).

. Some workarounds for the intel compiler.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Fix problems with column output, including the longstanding restriction
  that column output doesn't work for fields with names that contain the
  underscore character.

. Remove the setting of NF90_NOCLOBBER in calls to nf90_open (this was a
  one line change in cam_history.F90).  NF90_NOCLOBBER is not a valid
  argument to nf90_open, but most netcdf libraries were silently ignoring
  this.  We encountered an error when trying to link with netcdf4 libs that
  were built with hdf5 enabled.


. Fix bug in build-namelist that resulted in the default setting for forganic
  having the inputdata root directory prepended twice.  This only occurred
  when the inputdata root directory was specified as a relative path.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. add outnc_large_files to clm_inparm group

. remove atm_cdf64, ice_cdf64, lnd_cdf64, ocn_cdf64 -- not used

. add cldfrc_rhminl, cldfrc_rhminh for setting cloud fraction tuning
  parameters rhminl and rhminh.

One-line Summary: Add optional ESMFv3 interfaces in order to use the Gregorian calendar 

Purpose of changes: 
To use the Gregorian calendar, CAM must link with the actual ESMF library
instead of the default WRF fortran implementation of it. 
The configure option to do this remains unchanged: 
	-esmf_libdir directory
There is a new configure option:
	-esmf_libvers [ 2 (default) | 3 ]
that is only necessary if configure is unable to determine the library
version through an automatic test.  The default remains esmf_libvers=2 for
compatibility with the WRF implementation of the ESMF library.

This code includes the changes necessary for CAM to run with a Gregorian
calendar (existing namelist variable: calendar = 'GREGORIAN' ) but this
option will fail until the externals (drv,lnd,csm_share) have been updated.
	
Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): None

M      models/ocn/dom/ocn_time_manager.F90

M      models/ice/csim4/ice_time_manager.F90
Change ESMF variables from intent(in) to intent(inout) in order to use
ESMF version 3. When using a Gregorian calendar, have time managers
fake day 366 by repeating day 365. This allows the models to run on
leap-years without having to modify the solar zenith angle calculations.

M      models/atm/cam/src/utils/time_manager.F90
In addition to above, trap for Feb 29 of a non-leap year, which
might be invoked legitimately by a routine reading a dataset for a fixed
year (see below).

M      models/atm/cam/bld/configure
Require test of ESMF library when invoked with the existing option
-esmf_libdir in order to test which ESMF version is being used. Required
some re-ordering of flow.  Add option -esmf_libvers [ 2 (default) | 3 ] in
case the test fails.
	   
M      models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
If using the ESMF library, override default linker with ESMF recommendation

M      models/atm/cam/bld/config_files/definition.xml
Add esmf_libvers option

M      models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/mo_flbc.F90
Trap for Feb 29 of a non-leap year, which might be invoked legitimately by
a routine reading a dataset for a fixed year (see below).

Explanation of the Feb 29 trap:
When using a fixed year from a dataset, these routines create an integer
date by combining the fixed year with the current model day-of-year. 
This fails on Feb 29 of a leap year:
	        e.g.    fixed year      = 1990
	                model date      = 20000229
	                combined date   = 19900229
Since this is an unrealistic date, we trap for it here, using Feb 28
instead of Feb 29.

One-line Summary: Alternative OpenMP in FV dynamics

Purpose of changes: In FV dynamics, OpenMP is applied in the vertical direction. For example, for
cases with one level per subdomain, OpenMP becomes meaningless. An option has been added to instead
apply OpenMP to horizontal loops throughout sw_core and tp_core. Because this involves whether or
not to include directives, the option is necessarily a compile-time option. In order to apply this
option, one must define the CPP flag INNER_OMP. One should not do this in general, since
for cases where there are enough levels per subdomain to apply OpenMP, there is less OpenMP
overhead applying it vertically. If the user does not define INNER_OMP, the precompiled code
will be identical to the previous tag.

Tag name: cam3_6_54
Originator(s): eaton
Date: Mon Aug  3 11:23:46 MDT 2009
One-line Summary: Update externals to be consistent with ccsm4_0_beta20.

Purpose of changes:

. Updated externals as follows:
  clm3_6_19        -> clm3_6_46
  cice4_0_20090226 -> cice4_0_20090721
  scripts4_090428  -> scripts4_090722b
  docn7_090107     -> docn7_090720

  **NOTE** clm3_6_46 has a known bug in the hybrid dynamic pft code.
    Consequently this tag should not be used in hybrid mode for transient
    simulations (climatology runs are OK).  The fix will be added to the
    next CAM commit.

. Mods so that SCAM works with the updated CLM and with trop_mam3.

. Added WACCM use case for 1850 track1 simulations.

. Added use case for 1850 track1 w/ 2X CO2 simulations.

. Updated regression tests to use the CCSM version of cprnc.

List all subroutines added and what they do:

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/use_cases/waccm_1850_track1.xml
. use case for waccm 1850 track1 runs

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
. updated externals as summarized above.

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
. add code to use sim_year in generating the clm namelist
. update code for clm namelist to be consistent with clm3_6_46
. add -DCO2A to the cppdefs.  The clm namelist is now being set with the 
  variable co2_type='diagnostic' so it always listens to the atm to recieve
  the surface CO2 concentration.  -DCO2A is needed when building the
  coupler to make sure these fields are always allocated.
. added capability to not include the aerosol deposition dataset in the CLM
  namelist when CAM will provide the deposition fluxes to the coupler.
  Note: due to CLM bug the aerosol deposition dataset currently needs to be
  added to the CLM namelist whether it's used or not.

models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. define -DCO2A for building the cpl7 code.  This is currently the only BGC
  option implemented.
. change -DMAXPATCH_PFT=4 to -DMAXPATCH_PFT=numpft+1 for CLM build.
. add new CLM directory for mct or esmf component interface.
. add new CICE directories for mct or esmf component interface.
. hack to modify output of CICE configure in SCAM mode since the CICE
  configure doesn't support SCAM mode.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
. update clm defaults for consistency with clm3_6_43

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
. add sim_year
. remove old clm variables: csm_doflxave, irad
. add new clm variables: rtm_nsteps, urban_hac, urban_traffic

One-line Summary:
	
  Cleanup the old CAM3 prognostic aerosol code files and use
  the chemistry preprocessor only when customizing the chemistry.

Purpose of changes:
	
  The old CAM3 prognostic aerosol routines have been replicated 
  in the MOZART chemistry framework.  The deprecated configure and
  run-time options and source code have been removed to improve
  maintainability.

  The configure script only invokes the chemistry preprocessor only 
  when the chemistry is customized which is done by providing the code files 
  generated by the preprocessor for the pre-defined chemistry packages.
  The purpose of this is to avoid portability and long path name issues 
  associated with the chemistry preprocessor and shorten the configure time.

One-line Summary: fixes for history buffer restart files

Purpose of changes:

. Some bugs have been discovered in the netcdf history buffer restart
  files.  Restart failures can occur when multiple time samples are being
  written to a history file, and the restart occurs at a point when the
  history buffers must be written to a restart file.

  This commit fixes part of the problem, i.e., the errors encountered when
  trying to write some history buffer restart files.  But there is an
  outstanding problem which will be fixed in a subsequent commit, i.e.,
  some history buffer restart files will contain corrupted data which
  impacts the next time sample written in the sequence.  Things are OK for
  subsequent time samples until another restart occurs.  The workaround is
  to use mfilt=1 for all history files that use averaging periods which
  will require writing a history buffer restart file.

. Update to pio50_prod

. Some logfile cleanup.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): see above

One-line Summary: bug fix for proper selection of cam initial files with ccsm; remove 
	-Mrecursive from pgi debug build; prep code for intel compilers

Purpose of changes: 
intel compilers limit line length to 132 chars; also, code work-arounds were required in 
some instances of use association and array subscripting

the use of -Mrecursive was tripping up a cam regression test (with pgi); after discussion 
it was deemed unneccessary for debug builds

One-line Summary: Fix for running F compsets from ccsm4_0_beta16 and later.

Purpose of changes:

. modify build-namelist so that it generates a landmask file for the CAMDOM
  component namelist that is consistent with the one generated for the CICE
  namelist.
  Note that the fix is for running the F compsets from the ccsm4_0_beta16
  and later tags.  Using the ccsm scripts to run F compsets from this cam
  tag is broken due to an inconsistency between the scripts and the CLM
  tag.  We will be updating the CLM external to fix this problem shortly.

. Update to the latest scripts and pio tags.  Updating to the latest
  scripts tag has temporarily broken the ability to run F compsets via the
  ccsm scripts in this CAM tag.

One-line Summary: more accurate reproducible sum; additional OpenMP 
parallelism.

Purpose of changes:

1) Modify repro_sum fixed-point algorithm to improve accuracy.
   In certain situations, numerical cancellation can degrade accuracy 
   of original repro_sum algorithm as compared to floating-point-based
   algorithms. New algorithm is nearly exact, employing variable 
   precision as needed. This results in roundoff level differences.

2) Introduce OpenMP parallelism in physics and chemistry routines 
   that are not called within the major loop over chunks.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: 

- Cost of new repro_sum algorithm is higher than that of the old
  algorithm. Experiments indicate that the additional cost is
  not significant.

One-line Summary: new solar data code; update prescribed forcing data.

Purpose of changes:

. A new module (solar_data) has been added with capabilities to read
  datasets containing either total solar irradiance (TSI) or spectrally
  resolved solar irradiance (SSI).  Currently only the TSI code, needed for
  the track1 transient runs, is active.

. Updates to prescribed forcing data:
  - New TSI and SSI datasets from Caspar Ammann.
  - New 1850 and 2000 climatologies for both BAM and ozone from
    Jean-Francois Lamarque.
  - New GHG data (CO2, CH4, N2O, F11*, F12) from Doug Kinnison.
  - New volcanic emissions (eruptive) data from Caspar Ammann.

. A new use case (1850-2005_track1) has been implemented for the 1850-2005
  transient runs for track1 physics.

. configure has been modified to invoke the CICE configure with the args
  "-ntr_aero 0 -ntr_pond 1 -ntr_iage 0".  The -ntr_aero setting was already
  being used; the -ntr_pond and -ntr_iage settings are new.  This is for
  consistency with how the CCSM F cases are configured.  The values for
  -ntr_pond and -ntr_iage are the defaults, so this doesn't change
  answers.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. The chemistry/utils/prescribed_* modules all contained a bug which did
  not allow the data_type variable to be set to INTERP_MISSING_MONTHS (the
  module variable was declared char*8).

. The interpic_new utility was assuming that all global attributes are text
  strings.  This was causing failures on input files produced by the NCO
  operators which contain a global attribute of type integer.

. build-namelist wasn't recognizing a value of "0" in the use case file
  because a conditional statement was testing whether the value was true
  rather than whether the value was defined.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. new namelist variables for the solar_data module:
  character(len=256) :: solar_data_file = ''
  character(len=8)   :: solar_data_type = 'SERIAL' ! "FIXED" or "SERIAL"
  integer            :: solar_data_ymd = 0         ! YYYYMMDD for "FIXED" type
  integer            :: solar_data_tod = 0         ! seconds of day for "FIXED" type
  real(r8)           :: solar_const                ! constant TSI (W/m2)

. The following namelist variables have been removed:
  bndtvscon, rampyear_scon, scenario_scon, scon

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. updates to 2000 climatology for ozone, prescribed BAM
. update fixed GHG values to be consistent with year 2000 from the new GHG
  dataset. 

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

One-line Summary: volcano emissions and optics; 1850_track1 updates;
  build-namelist mods (improve AMIP setup)

Purpose of changes:

. Add new code for reading volcano emission datasets.  This includes a new
  feature to mask emissions below the tropopause.  Currently the volcanic
  emissions are radiatively active by default only when used with camrt and
  with BAM (prescribed or prognostic).  This functionality is needed for the
  track1 transient runs.

. Add module to diagnose the location of the tropopause. Multiple
  algorithms are provided, some of which may not be able to identify a
  tropopause in all situations. To handle these cases, an analytic
  defintion and a climatology are provided that can be used to fill in
  when the original algorithm fails. The troppause temperature and
  pressure are determined and can be output to the history file.  (From
  Charles Bardeen.)

. Tuning mod: set rhminl=0.92 for FV 1.9x2.5 w/ cam3 or cam3_5* physics.

. Update the 1850_track1 use case with new 1850 prescribed BAM aerosols
  from Jean-Francois Lamarque.

. Update build-namelist to allow setting all namelist variables recognized
  by the perf_mod module.  Also change default for timing output files to
  use a single file.

. Update build-namelist to enforce consistency between the SST and ocean
  domain files used by CAM-DOM and the prescribed CICE mode.  Also add
  variables to the CAM namelist that are needed to specify the first and
  last years of a multi-year SST dataset (for AMIP runs).

. Update the FV inidat code to replace global sums by distributed sums in
  the polar averaging.  This results in roundoff level differences.  (From
  Jim Edwards.)

. Add support for radius dependent optics calculation for volcanic
  aerosols.  This code will only be turned on for RRTMG.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. The volcano emissions code used in cam3 was broken when changes were made
  to remove assumptions about rectangular lat/lon grids from the physics
  code.  The new code added with this commit replaces the old code which
  has been removed.

integer            :: prescribed_volcaero_tod       ! time of day (sec) relative to prescribed_volcaero_ymd

. Remove variables used by old volcano emission modules: bndtvvolc and
  strat_volcanic. 

. Add support for all namelist variables recognized by the perf_mod module.

. Add the variables stream_year_first and stream_year_last which are used
  to specify, respectively, the first and last years of data in a
  multi-year SST dataset.  This is needed for AMIP runs.

. The new tropopause diagnostic code uses a tropopause climatology file.
  The default (which is also used by the trop_mozart code) can be
  overridden via the namelist variable tropopause_climo_file.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. new dataset for 1850 climatology of prescribed bulk aerosols.

. replace sst_HadOIBl_bc_32x64_clim_c030228.nc by
  sst_HadOIBl_bc_32x64_clim_c050526.nc because the latter file has a time
  coordinate that's recognized by cice.

One-line Summary: Extend cam3.5 physics to unstructured grids; bug fix to 
test scripts for testing of ccsm and cleanup

Purpose of changes:
. Extend cam3.5 physics to unstructured grids.  This involves the code used
  to interpolate the prescribed aerosols and ozone datasets.  It does not
  involve lots of code used by the prognostic chemistry schemes to
  interpolate surface emission datasets.

  The new interpolation code parallelizes the calculation rather than
  interpolating on masterproc and scattering the results.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
. The changes made to the interpolation code to support unstructured grids
  fixed code bugs related to the treatment of interpolation points at or
  near the poles.  This introduces larger than roundoff changes in the
  interpolated fields.

One-line Summary: add cam3_5_1 option & tuning; change solar constant; change cice default

Purpose of changes:

. Add a new configure option, "-phys cam3_5_1".  This is to configure the
  "track1" simulations out of the box.  cam3_5_1 is the same build as
  cam3_5, but the namelist settings are modified to set the critical Froude
  number to 1.0 and to set the FV polar filter to use FFT always (these are
  the same values that are used by default in the latest development code).

. Tuning parameter for track1: set rhminl=0.90 for 2 degree runs using RK
  microphysics. 

. Change to solar constant.  Notes from Caspar Ammann:

. Turn off the aerosol tracers in CICE:
  The CAM "standalone" configuration uses the "prescribed" mode of CICE.
  The recent addition of aerosol tracers into CICE is causing problems in
  the prescribed mode, so we have decided as a short term fix to turn off
  the aerosol tracers in CICE.  It is an open science question whether the
  aerosol tracers should be turned on in the CICE prescribed mode since
  this mode allows only vertical transport of the tracers.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag:

Summarize any changes to answers: new climate in all configs except
  adiabatic and ideal physics due to changing the solar constant.  In
  addition the tuning parameter change for track1 affects 2 degree FV runs
  using the RK microphysics (cam3, cam3_5, and cam3_5_1 physics options).
  I suspect that turning off the aerosol tracers in CICE will also change
  answers although that change wasn't tested in isolation.

One-line Summary: mods to ramp_co2; update externals

Purpose of changes:

. The option to ramp CO2 at a specified annual rate currently required the
  user to specify the start date via the namelist variable
  ramp_co2_start_ymd.  This has been modified so that if this variable is
  not specified, the default behavior is to start the ramping at the
  beginning of the run.

. Update to the following externals:
  drvseq3_0_09
  clm3_6_19
  cice4_0_20090226
  scripts4_090226

  ** Note ** Updating the CLM and CICE externals results in a new climate
  for any configuration that provides deposition of carbon/dust to the
  surface (currently trop_mam3, trop_bam, trop_mozart).  The new CLM and
  CICE versions will use deposition fluxes from the atm whenever they are
  provided. 

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. bug fix from Sungsu in the MG microphyics:
  Add the term mnucct+msacwi to the calculation of tlat.
  These terms do not appear in the cam3_6 version of MG microphysics, so
  this fix will not affect the "track2b" simulations.  It does change
  answers in the version of MG microphysics currently on CAM's trunk which
  came from the end of the modal branch (modal12_cam3_6_26).

One-line Summary: option to use "cam3_6" physics; add deposition fluxes for
                : prognostic BAM

** N.B. ** The current "out of the box" configuration matches that of the
   end of the modal branch, modal12_cam3_6_26, plus the bug fix mentioned
   below.  This is not a tuned configuration, and is not one of the configs
   being evaluated as the possible cam4.  The candidate cam4 configurations
   require setting various arguments to the configure command.  There is
   also a large amount of candidate code still on a branch which will be
   merged to the trunk in the near future.

Purpose of changes:

. Add capability to run with "cam3_6" physics, defined as cam3_5 + a
  version of MG microphysics prior to adding the new treatment for ice +
  prognostic BAM.  cam3_6 retains the camrt radiation package, the HB
  vertical diffusion code, the Hack Shallow convection, and the ZM deep
  convection w/ Neale/Richter modifications.  This option is configured by
  setting the argument "-phys cam3_6" to configure.  To run with prescribed
  instead of prognostic BAM add the argument "-chem none" to configure.

. Send the carbon and dust deposition fluxes to the coupler when prognostic
  BAM is active.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): in stratiform.F90

. Fix bug in stratiform.F90 (remove conditional surrounding the statement
  that sets the tendency of cloud ice number due to detrainment of Nc).

Describe any changes made to build system:

. Changes to configure: add valid option "-phys cam3_6".

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. Move cloud_fraction namelist variables into their own namelist group.
  Change names: freeze_dry -> cldfrc_freeze_dry
                rhminl_31  -> cldfrc_rhminl_31
  Add cldfrc_ice to turn on/off the calculation of ice cloud fraction.

. Add variable atm_dep_flux to turn on sending deposition fluxes to the
  coupler.  This is set by build-namelist when the chemistry option is one
  that provides the desired fluxes.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: not checked

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: none

List all subroutines added and what they do:

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam3_6/cldwat2m.F90
. This is the version of cldwat2m being used for cam3_6.  It came
  originally from modal03_cam3_6_24 and has been modified for the "track2"
  runs.  This is temporary.  The physics that has been backed out of
  cldwat2m needs to be implemented with conditional logic in
  physics/cam/cldwat2m.F90.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
. add defaults for cldfrc_freeze_dry and cldfrc_ice
. add default for atm_dep_flux

models/atm/cam/bld/config_files/defaults_waccm_ghg.xml
models/atm/cam/bld/config_files/defaults_waccm_mozart.xml
. remove setting phys=waccm

models/atm/cam/bld/config_files/definition.xml
. add cam3_6 as valid value for phys
. remove waccm as a valid value for phys.  This removes an unnecessary
  dependence between the phys and chem parameters.
. remove setting the default value for phys.  configure needs to determine
  the physics package before the configure object is initialized.

models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. add cam3_6 option to -phys
. Move the determination of the physics package ahead of determining the
  chemistry package in configure.  The physics packages have different
  default chemistry packages, so the physics package needs to be set first.
  Also remove waccm as a valid physics package value.  This created an
  unnecessary dependence between the chemistry and physics package settings
  that was causing problems as more options are added.  configure can do
  whatever needs to be done for waccm by checking the value of the
  chemistry package.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
. remove the phys="waccm" attributes.  In the gw_drag_file element the attribute
  was not needed.  In the solar_parms_file element it was replaced by
  duplicating the element and inserting chem="waccm_ghg" in one and
  chem="waccm_mozart" in the other.
. add defaults for cldfrc_freeze_dry and cldfrc_ice.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
. move cloud_fraction namelist variables into namelist group cldfrc_nl
. rename freeze_dry -> cldfrc_freeze_dry
         rhminl_31  -> cldfrc_rhminl_31
. add cldfrc_ice to switch whether the ice cloud fraction calculation is done
. add atm_dep_flux to indicate when CAM will send deposition fluxes to the
  coupler. 

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/chemistry.F90
. chem_timestep_tend - change intent of cam_out arg from in to inout.
. copy drydep for CB1 to cam_out%bcphodry
  copy drydep for CB2 to cam_out%bcphidry
  copy drydep for OC1 to cam_out%ocphodry
  copy drydep for OC2 to cam_out%ocphidry

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/mo_gas_phase_chemdr.F90
. add intent(out) arg drydepflx to gas_phase_chemdr, and set it.

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/mozart/mz_aerosols_intr.F90
. copy wetdep for OC2 to cam_out%ocphiwet
  copy wetdep for CB2 to cam_out%bcphiwet

models/atm/cam/src/control/camsrfexch_types.F90
. use phys_control module to query whether atm will send deposition fluxes
  to the coupler.

models/atm/cam/src/control/runtime_opts.F90
. remove cloud fraction namelist vars from cam_inparm
. add call to cldfrc_readnl

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/aerosol_intr.F90
. add cam_out to calling args for dust_wet_intr and dust_drydep_intr

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/aer_rad_props.F90
. add AEROD_V to default history output

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cloud_fraction.F90
. add method to read namelist cldfrc_nl

  fraction is computed, not the microphysics type

. copy wetdep for 4 dust bins to cam_out%dstwet[1-4]
. copy drydep for 4 dust bins to cam_out%dstdry[1-4]

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_control.F90
. add namelist variable atm_dep_flux.  access via the phys_getopts method.

via the ccsm scripts...

the run template scripts provided in the ~bld directory had not been updated since 
cice became the default sea ice model, requiring changes to the configure calls...

latest timing tag eliminated the need for an extra env var in cppdefs in order to 
limit the log output of the timing code...however, a change to the performance test 
script was required to account for unrelated format changes in the output...

  configure).  This is a combination of adding some control logic in the
  source code, and appropriately setting the default values of some
  namelist variables which is accomplished via mods to build-namelist.  The
  changes are:
  - cloud_fraction fixed so the new algorithms for ice cloud fraction are
    only invoked for the MG microphysics package.
  - set the default value of fcrit2 in gw_drag to 0.5 for CAM3 and CAM3_5
    physics.  The default in the current code is 1.0.
  - set fft_flt=0 for CAM3 and CAM3_5 versions.  This only applies to the FV
    dycore.  The current default is fft_flt=1 (which required building with
    ALT_PFT defined in the CAM3 and CAM3_5 versions of the code).

  Note 1: There are still some differences from the CAM3_5 version of the physics
  present in the current code:
  - The radiation code now uses a mass based relative humidity (rh) calc
    rather than a mole based one.  This is for consistency with other calcs
    of rh in the moist physics.
  - The radiation code assumes that the constituents are dry mixing ratios
    rather than moist when computing optical depths.  
  - the sea salt optics for camrt are now computed using two bins (coarse
    and accumulation modes) instead of one.  These optics calculations now
    depend on the available optics files.  We'd need some code modification
    along with a new optics file to enable a 1-bin version of sea salt
    optics used by cam3_5.

  Note 2: The above changes also apply to the cam3 physics.  But cam3
  physics is still not working due to the Neale/Richter convection mods not
  being optional.  This is still on the to do list.

. Remove the need to run the chemistry preprocessor for prognostic BAM
  (trop_bam).

. Update srf emission and external forcing files for both BAM and MAM to use
  the AEROCOM files for year 2000 (trop_mam3 was already using these files)
 
. Update CICE to cice4_0_20090211

. Update the 1870_prog_aero use case to use the aerocom emissions.
  Update the 1870_control use case to remove the trop_mam3 attribute from
  the emission datasets.  These datasets are used by either BAM or MAM
  prognostic aerosols.

. have build-namelist set the default values of the variables in the
  phys_control module, i.e., deep_scheme, eddy_scheme, shallow_scheme,
  srf_flux_avg, and microp_scheme, so that CAM version specific defaults
  will be set.  build-namelist also made responsible for setting fcrit2 and
  fft_flt.

. fix bug in sub add_default.  Needed to check for a defined return value
  from get_default_value rather than a true or false return value.  The
  valid return value "0" was causing the check to fail.

  module now reads it's own namelist.
. remove unused indforce variable

  microphysics and to return the cloud fraction for cam3_5 physics
  overwise.

. remove setting default value of fcrit2

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_control.F90
. replace the phys_{default,set}opts methods with phys_ctl_readnl so this
  module reads it's own namelist.
. Since the default physics packages depend on what physics version we want
  to run, allow build-namelist to set the defaults rather than hardcoding
  them.  Remove the hardcoding of initial values in the module variables.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/radiation.F90
. Remove radforce, indforce, and associated diagnostics.  This isn't
  supported by the new aerosol-radiation interfaces.

One-line Summary: Make trop_mam3 the default chemistry; integrate MAM with the MG microphysics.

Purpose of changes:

. Make trop_mam3 the default chemistry.
  - Don't require running the chemistry preprocessor for predefined chemistry
    schemes; currently only trop_mam3 has been reimplemented this way.
  - Add tuning to modal aerosols from Xiaohong.
  - Add boundary layer nucleation from Xiaohong.

. MG microphysics changes
  - add MG microphysics bug fix for diagnostic field used by wet dep codes
  - ice microphysics mods; MAM tuning
  - hook immersion freezing to modal dust

. Update RRTMG external
  - update rrtmg to latest tag, rrtmg_081203, which includes change to sw
    surface fluxes needed to balance the surface energy budget.

. changes for regression testing
  - modified the offline driver test to run at 1.9x2.5
  - change mo_apex.F90 to calculate latitude midpoints inline rather than
    relying on a quantity (clat_staggered) that's not available from all the
    dycores.  This is to get the regression tests working for the spectral
    dycores.
  - Removed the gensom and som config files from the regression tests.

. new external tags for almost all components to emulate current ccsm beta tags

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

. default chemistry set to trop_mam3

. Don't require running the chemistry preprocessor for predefined chemistry
  schemes; currently only trop_mam3 has been reimplemented this way.

. Refactor configure's -chem option.  This needed to be done to provide a way
  to turn off the default trop_mam3 chemistry.  At the same time, the
  overloaded use of "-chem none" to imply that the CAM3 prescribed aerosols
  and ozone were being used was removed.  Now "-chem none" is used to turn
  off all prognostic chemistry without implying which prescribed aerosols or
  ozone are used.  To do that new valid values, cam3 and cam3_5, have been
  added to the -phys argument.  "-phys cam3" now implies "-chem none" and
  that the CAM3 prescribed aerosols and ozone will be used.  This is not yet
  a completely implemented backwards compatibility switch for CAM3 physics
  because the Richter/Neale convection mods are still hardwired.  But the
  intention is to have the "-phys cam3" option eventually provide the
  complete CAM3 physics package.  "-phys cam3_5" also implies "-chem none",
  but instead of the CAM3 aerosols and ozone, the newer prescribed BAM
  aerosols and the ozone dataset from J.F. Lamarque will be used.

  In addition to the new configure functionality, quite a bit of new error
  checking has been added to try and prevent building the model with
  inconsistent physics packages.

. The -gensom and "-ocn som" options were removed from configure.  The new
  SOM functionality is currently only available via the CCSM scripts.

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
. option added to allow cam's build-namelist to call build-namelist for cice

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:
. trop_mam3 is much more expensive than prescribed BAM

. the build will be faster when the chemistry preprocessor isn't needed

One-line Summary: generalize and optimize load balancing options

Purpose of changes: 

1) Generalize the definition of load balancing options
0, 1, 3, and 4 to be able to use more processes in the physics than in
the dynamics.

Previously there was support for using additional
processes in the physics only when specifying the most aggressive
load balancing (phys_loadbalance==2). The other options have been
generalized to assign work to all physics processes.
For example, phys_loadbalance==0 will now distribute work
to otherwise idle processes, but will (still) not trade work with
other processes active during the dynamics. When the number of
physics and dynamics processes are the same, the behavior of
the load balancing options is unchanged.

2) Introduce new default communication option for physics 
load balancing (phys_alltoall = -1) that uses information about
nature of the communication to choose between a point-to-point
algorithm and an MPI collective.

When using more physics processes than dynamics processes, and
when using load balancing options other than phys_loadbalance=2,
most processes send and receive data to/from only a small number of
the other processes. In these situations, a point-to-point implementation
of the data arrangment is often faster than calling MPI_Alltoallv.
This observation is now "implemented" in the code. It can be overridden
by setting phys_alltoall to 0 (to use collective) or 1 (to use
point-to-point algorithm).

3) Performance optimizations in FV (mod_comm and geopk_d) 
and dynamics/physics MPI communications (spmd_util).

Eliminated sending/receiving zero length messages in one
of the communication options in both the FV transposes and
in the physics/dynamics transposes. Also added support for
the mpi_isend/mpi_send option (modc_send_cdcore) to the
geopk_d algoritm.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: 

- Changed the range of phys_alltoall to include -1, and made -1 the default.

processes than dynamics processes

One-line Summary: Improvements to communication, other misc. improvements

Purpose of changes: Improve communication performance at scale.

Changes are bit-for-bit.

MPI performance in CAM for runs with large numbers of processes has proven 
to be erratic in certain circumstances, sometimes even leading to failures
due to exhaustion of system buffer space. Aspects of this behavior have been 
observed on three different platforms (Atlas at LLNL, Cray XT, and IBM BG/P),
and is likely to occur with some process count on all systems.

Through empirical experiments, we identified a number of communication protocols
that were implemented in the swapm routine in the spmd_utils module that eliminate 
these problems. However, no one protocol was best in all situations, so a number
of protocols were imported into the mod_comm irregular communication routines
(which are used for intra-FV-dynamics transposes, gathers and scatters,
and geopotential communications) and the choice of what to use can be 
specified at runtime. Reasonable defaults were determined, however.

As part of this exercise, we also cleaned up the swapm routine,
removing the options that are never exercised, so the logic in mod_comm and 
swapm are now very similar. 

(Fun fact: swapm communication protocols were originally developed for PSTSWM 
and were used in CCM/MP2D.)

The ALTGATHER logic, used to avoid problems on the Cray XT when too many "unexpected"
messages arrive at the root of the gather, is now supported within mod_comm as one
of the options, and is enabled by default. Similarly, new routines with robust 
behavior but without any performance degradation were made the defaults for I/O-related 
gathers for the spectral dycores.

The new communication options, implemented in the mod_comm mp_sendirr 
and mp_recvirr irregular communication routines, include:

(1) option to handshake; that is, the source will not post its send until the
corresponding receive has already been posted; this mitigates against unnecessary
contention and buffering; in this case, ready send is used instead of send.

(2) option to use blocking rather than nonblocking send.

(3) option to limit the number of outstanding message requests; this mitigates against 
exhausting buffer space and performance degradation when the number of sources and
destinations for a process during a collective operation becomes large.

(4) option to call MPI_Alltoallv. (Note, this is typically not the best choice within
the FV dycore on Atlas or on the Cray XT, but it usually is best on the IBM BG/P.)

(5) option to perform certain intra-FV-dynamics transposes in pairs.

(6) option to perform intra-FV-dynamics tracer transposes N at a time; irregular transpose 
structures were replaced with 4-D arrays; also, the partial real*4 tracer support was 
removed.

We also changed ordering of target tasks to dimensional-exchange ordering, as used in swapm,
rather than 1 to N; this mitigates against contention.

Changes were also made to the logic for error checking with the fast reproducible sum 
calculation; testing and warning message are now run-time options, off by default; in 
particular, the collective sums are computed once only unless the user requests error
checking.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): Temporary 1-line conditionally compilable patches
were added to six pio-related files, as workaround for ifort compiler bug.

One-line Summary: CCSM/PIO build; BGP mods; getfil; extend build-namelist use_case

Purpose of changes:

. Modify CAM's configure so that when building the CAM component via the
  CCSM build scripts, PIO is built as part of CAM.  This is a temporary
  hack!

. Add standalone CAM build support for BGP.

. Modify getfil so that the default is to abort when a requested file isn't
  found.  This makes it easier to detect this common error.

. Extend the functionality of build-namelist so that use case
  specifications can contain variables that are not namelist variables just
  like the namelist_defaults_cam.xml file does.  This is needed to support
  building complex namelist values like those used by the chemistry code to
  specify the emission datasets for multiple constituents.

. Check the element names in the use case defaults file and if the name
  isn't in the definition file then don't add the name to the namelist.
. The namelist defaults object corresponding to the use case needs to be
  saved, and searched for default values before the base defaults file is
  searched.  Encapsulate this in a new routine, get_default_values.

models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. add utils/pio to Filepath produced for ccsm build.
. add -D_NETCDF macro to the $cfg_cppdefs for a ccsm build.

One-line Summary: RRTMG fixes and new cloud diagnostics

Purpose of changes:

. Update RRTMG external to 
  - Fixes bug in restart (some wrong intents)
  - Fixes problem with minimal solar zenith angle for WACCM.

. RRTMG diagnostics
  - Cleanup of addfld calls
  - Output aerosol masses as seen by radiation

. Cloud diagnostics moved into a new module, cloud_diagnostics.  This
  module is currently only implemented for RRTMG.

. Add capability to compute optical properties for volcanic aerosols.

. Extend the rad_constituents interface to allow setting gas species mixing
  ratios to zero.  This is done by using the specifier 'Z' in the
  appropriate namelist variable in place of 'P' or 'D'.

. Bugfix in new ISCCP simulator.

. Modify how radiation package is specified to configure.  The -rrtmg
  switch has been replaced by the argument -rad which takes either rrtmg or
  camrt as values.  The current default is camrt.

. Update test_driver.sh to use pgi-7.2-5 on bangkok and calgary.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. fix an index problem in the new ISCCP simulator

. change char*80 to 256 in filename declaration in mo_flbc.F90

Describe any changes made to build system:

. remove -rrtmg switch from configure.  replaced by -rad argument which
  takes either rrtmg or camrt as values.  The current default is camrt.

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

One-line Summary: Refactor restart files from binary to netcdf using PIO

Purpose of changes: Improved memory profile allow parallel IO for restart 
	in NetCDF format

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system: Added external PIO library

Describe any changes made to the namelist:  Added pio_ctl namelist 
                        default           allowed values
	io_stride         1                 1 - n                    
	iotype_name     'netcdf'      'netcdf', 'pnetcdf'
	pio_restart      .false.             
	num_iotasks       n                 1 - n
        where n is the total number of compute tasks
        io_stride and num_iotasks control the number of tasks participating in IO, If only io_stride is set
	  num_iotasks will be adjusted automatically.   
	pio_restart can be used to turn off the pio facility and use the old binary restart.  
	If you find that you need to set this please let me know so that I can address the problem, we plan to make PIO
	the only option in an upcoming release. 
	iotype_name allows a choice of netcdf or pnetcdf libraries - currently netcdf appears to perform better but
	that may change depending on platform, decomposition and problem size.

One-line Summary: Combine CAM-Chem and WACCM chemistry codes.

Purpose of changes: Ease of chemistry code mantainance  and
 provide more flexability in the aerosol and gas phase chemistry 
 configurations.
	
Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

 Changes to configure:

  - new configure options :
      -prog_species  [SO4[,DST[,SSLT[,OC[,BC[,GHG[,CARBON16]]]]]]]
         Configure will generate a preprocessor input file
         for any combination of these predefined prognostics
         aerosol and ghg packages.
      -edit_chem_mech
         This allows the user to edit the mechanism file before
         it is processed.  Default editor is vi.  The user can
         specify another editor via the CAMCHEM_EDITOR environment
         variable.
      -usr_mech_infile $mechanism_file
         This allows the user to specify a preprocessor input file.

  - configure invokes the chemstry preprocessor to generate chemistry 
    solver code

  - predefined chemistry options:
      -chem trop_mozart | trop_ghg | trop_aero | waccm_mozart | waccm_ghg

  - when configured with the option -chem trop_mozart | waccm_mozart
     the preprocessor will use a predefined "standard" preprocessor input file

  - when configured with the option -chem trop_ghg | trop_aero | waccm_ghg
     or with the -prog_species  SO4 | DST | SSLT | OC | BC | GHG | CARBON16
     a preprocessor input file is created

 New features:
	
  - The ability to specify short-lived chemical tracers which will
    not be transported.  These species are specified via a "ShortLived"
    species designation in the preprocessor input file.

  - The ability to skip solving the chemical equations some time
    steps.  The chemical equation are solved each time step by
    default.  This can be changed via the chem_freq namelist variable.

  - The prescribed mozart ozone and aerosols for the radiation can now be used 
    with any chemistry configuration (and without any chemistry).
	
Describe any changes made to the namelist:

  Chemistry options are now read from "chem_inparm" namelist in atm_in.
	
  Pass "chem_rad_passive = .true." to build-namelist to set the rad_climate variable
  so that the chemical tracers are radiatively passive.

  emis_date --> srf_emis_date
  emis_type --> srf_emis_type

  WACCM
    now uses srf_emis_specifier as with CAM-chem
	
    lbc_file       --> flbc_file
    lbc_fixed_date --> flbc_date
    lbc_senario    --> flbc_type

    sad_fixed_date --> sad_date

One-line Summary: RRTMG uses 3D CO2 and O2 fields.  Update externals for
                  consistency with CCSM tags.

Purpose of changes:

. Modify RRTMG to accept 3D fields of CO2 and O2.

. Remove output of the vertically integrated cloud diagnostics from RRTMG
  since those diagnostics aren't available.

. Fix logic so new ISCCP simulator is available for use with RRTMG.

. update driver code to drv/seq_mct/trunk_tags/drvseq2_0_33

. update cice code to cice/branch_tags/cice4_0_20080930b_brnchT_20081008

. update csm_share code to csm_share/trunk_tags/share3_081009
  - this includes larger than roundoff changes to the surface fluxes
    resulting from a bug fix introduce at share3_080811

. update the scripts code to scripts/trunk_tags/scripts4_081009

. Move the external definition for the RRTMG code into a new file,
  models/atm/cam/SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES.  This was done to avoid the need
  for separate external definition for RRTMG in the CCSM tags.  The tag
  used for the CAM src will now automatically include the RRTMG external.

One-line Summary: new cloud optics for RRTMG

Purpose of changes:

. Add new cloud optics for RRTMG.

  - Note 1: This code has been added to the trunk to provide early
    access for developers.  However, the port of the code from the Andrew's
    branch to the trunk has not yet been scientifically validated.

  - Note 2: The RRTMG code is not yet the default.  It is enabled by
    specifying -rrtmg on the configure commandline.  When this is done, the
    default for the cloud optics is set to be the mitchell ice cloud optics
    and the conley liquid cloud optics.  There is currently a capability to
    switch the cloud optics back to CAM3 versions by setting the namelist
    variables liqcldoptics='slingo' and icecldoptics='ebertcurry'.

  - Note 3: There is still alot of work to be done to clean up the new
    cloud optics code.  But exactly what needs to be done will depend on
    whether both the new and old cloud optics schemes need to be available
    for use with RRTMG.  The old optics will remain available for use in a
    CAM3 backwards compatibility mode in any case.

. Add new version (3.8) of the ISCCP cloud simulator.  This version only
  works with RRTMG.  The old cloud simulator is maintained to work with
  CAMRT.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Some bug fixes in cam.cpl7.template needed for CCSM builds
  - fix the logic for the CAM_CHEM variable so that setting CAM_CHEM='none'
    results in setting the arg "-chem none" for configure.
  - remove the override that forced CAM to always be built with threading on.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. Add the following variables for cloud optics:

  - liqcldoptics type="char*32" valid_values="slingo,conley"
    filepath and name for ice optics data for rrtmg

  - icecldoptics type="char*32" valid_values="ebertcurry,mitchell"
    filepath and name for ice optics data for rrtmg

  - iceopticsfile type="char*256"
    filepath and name for ice optics data for rrtmg

  - liqopticsfile type="char*256" 
    filepath and name for liquid cloud (gamma distributed) optics data for
    rrtmg

. Add new variable, doisccp_38, to turn on the new version of the isccp
  cloud simulator.  This is a logical variable and is false by default.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: 

. New physprop files from Steve Ghan.  New variables have been added to the
  new set of files (*_c080918.nc), and all the existing variables have the
  same values as in the previous set of files (*_c080819.nc).

  of TOTPRECP as actual args passed through the gas_phase_chemdr interface.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cldwat2m.F90
. fix the comments for prain and nevapr to indicate that they are totals of
  rain + snow.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/stratiform.F90
. remove the fields TOTEVAPR (nevapr+evapsnow) and TOTPRECP
  (prain+prodsnow) from the physics buffer.  These fields were double
  counting the contribution from snow since it is already included in the
  prain and nevapr fields returned by subroutines pcond and mmicro_pcond.

One-line Summary: build-namelist fix and update driver

Purpose of changes:

. build-namelist was modified to properly produce the list of input
  datasets when the root directory has been specified as an environment
  variable reference, e.g., "-csmdata \$DIN_LOC_ROOT".  This is a
  requirement for how the CCSM scripts invoke build-namelist.

. Update to new driver code.  The new driver contains a workaround for the
  performance problem being encountered on bluefire when running more than
  1 thread per task.  Driver updated to drvseq2_0_27.

. pathf90 section of Makefile modified to turn off optimization for the 2
  RRTMG modules that take excess amounts of time to compile (or won't
  compile at all).

. change valid value of lnd from clm2 to clm

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
. modify so that the namelist files for the driver, CLM, and CICE are only
  written out for CAM standalone scripts.
. modify so that the list of inputdata file produced has the root directory
  properly stripped, even when it's in the form of an environment variable
  as is the case when the CCSM scripts invoke build-namelist.

models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
. modify to remove optimization from build of rrtmg_sw_k_g.f90 and
  rrtmg_lw_k_g.f90 when using pathf90.

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml

The baseline test failures are due to roundoff level differences in the
driver code.  Many of the baseline tests pass either because the
configuration doesn't involve surface interactions (e.g., adiabatic, ideal
physics, aqua-planet), or due to some unknown coincidence all the FV
1.9x2.5 tests are passing.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag: cam3_6_07

Summarize any changes to answers: BFB or roundoff.  The roundoff
differences were verified by looking at the differences in the cprnc output
for all fields at each timestep for a short run.  The normal perturbation
growth test isn't applicable because it uses aquaplanet mode which is BFB.

One-line Summary: build-namelist fix; new radiation and microphysics 
	diagnostic fields

Purpose of changes:
. fix build-namelist to recognize the input datasets that occur in the
  rad_climate and rad_diag_N variables.  This is only relevent 
  for the -test option which checks that all required input datasets exist
  on a local disk, and for the -inputdata option which writes a list of the
  required input datasets to a file.

. Add precip fluxes calculations and output fields (MGFLXPRC, 
  MGFLXSNW) to cldwat2m.F90 (from Jen Kay).

. Add additional radiation fields (FLDS, FSUTOA) to radiation.F90 and 
  radsw.F90 (from Jen Kay).

One-line Summary: new physprop (optics + microphysics) files; fixes for
  RRTMG aerosol optics; build/run fixes for CICE

Purpose of changes:

. Update code to read new physprop datasets which contain updated aerosol
  optics and microphysical properties for both the CAMRT and RRTMG codes.
  These are the latest data from Steve Ghan that have been converted to CAM
  naming conventions by Andrew Conley.  These physprop datasets are the
  ones currently being used by the radiation team in the evaluation of the
  RRTMG code.

. Update the relative humidity calculation done in the CAMRT code to be
  consistent with the rh calcs in the moist physics code and with the
  value of rh written to the history output (i.e., rh=q/qsat).

. Fix bug in reading aerosol lw optical properties.  This bug was the cause
  of RRTMG solutions not being invariant when task and/or thread counts were
  changed.  This did not affect CAMRT simulations.

. Remove storage of optical depths from RRTMG code.
  - Update rrtmg external definition to trunk_tags/rrtmg_080826

. The cam3_6_05 commit included new driver code that allows different
  components to use different thread counts.  This is controlled using
  variables from the driver namelist group ccsm_pes.  Update build-namelist
  to write this namelist group to drv_in.  By default the *_nthreads
  variables are set to 1.  This means that runs using cam3_6_05 and
  cam3_6_06 will run with 1 thread in each task regardless of the setting
  of OMP_NUM_THREADS.  build-namelist will now set the value of *_nthreads
  to the value of OMP_NUM_THREADS.  Also, the user may explicitly set the
  values of *_nthreads to achieve a heterogeneous threading configuration.

. Fixes to regression tests on jaguar addressing CICE and quad-core issues.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Fix bug in reading aerosol lw optical properties.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. iradae is no longer used by RRTMG

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. new physprops datasets.

. change the focndomain defaults for 1/2 and 1/4 degree fv to use the gx1v5
  ocn grid rather than USGS.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: 

models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/aer_rad_props.F90
. no longer needed since the physics/cam version of this file is identical
  to it after the relative humidity expression is updated

List all subroutines added and what they do: none

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
. update rrtmg external to trunk_tags/rrtmg_080826

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
. set defaults and write the ccsm_pes namelist group to drv_in

models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
. remove optimization from the PGI build of the RRTMG files
  rrtmg_lw_k_g.f90 and rrtmg_sw_k_g.f90.


models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_defaults_cam.xml
. new physprops datasets

models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
. add driver namelist group ccsm_pes to control the task/thread layout.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/aer_rad_props.F90
. 

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_prop.F90
. Update code to read new physprop datasets.  Mainly this is new variable
  names in the netcdf files.
. bugfix for reading lw_ext data.  flw_ext was dimensioned with nswbands
  instead of nlwbands.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radiation.F90
models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radlw.F90
models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/radsw.F90
. remove dotau option for controlling calculation frequency of optical
  depths.  This was previously set by using the iradae namelist variable
  which has now been removed from RRTMG.

models/atm/cam/test/system/TCB.sh
. modify code to look for 'csim4' in config_files to flag that cice is not
  the ice model

models/atm/cam/test/system/TBR.sh
models/atm/cam/test/system/TER.sh
. set OMP_NUM_THREADS to CAM_RESTART_THREADS before calling build-namelist
. put conditional around invocation of the cice build-namelist so that it's
  not invoked when csim4 is being used.

models/atm/cam/test/system/TSM.sh
. set OMP_NUM_THREADS to CAM_THREADS before calling build-namelist

models/atm/cam/test/system/CAM_runcmnd.sh
. generalized the call to aprun to assign the number of tasks per node
  based on the requested tasks and threads, assuming the use of quad-core
  nodes

models/atm/cam/test/system/test_driver.sh
. modified task/thread request for hybrid testing on jaguar to work
  with changes to test scripts for using the new cice model; fix to default
  workspace used for test output
. version of showproj - the utility to grab a charge account for a user -
  is now consistent with what ccsm is using...

models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/f10c3dm
models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/h5x8adm
models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/h5x8dm
models/atm/cam/test/system/config_files/h5x8idm
. set  -ice csim4.  The f10c3dm config is designed to test the cam3.5
  configuration.  The homme tests aren't currently using a sea ice model,
  but when they do the csim4 model will probably be the easiest to work
  with initially.


If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the
appropriate machine below.  All failed tests must be justified.

. The regression testing was carried out in two stages.  First, all changes
  except using the new optics/microphysics data for camrt and switching the
  expression for rh used by camrt were tested and shown to be bit-for-bit.
  Then those changes were made and the testing redone.  The second set of
  regression tests which include failed baseline tests is what is reported
  below.

One-line Summary: Makefile mods for AIX; mods for RRTMG

Purpose of changes:

. Change the default optimization for AIX from -O3 to -O2.  This is to
  address an irreproducibility problem on bluefire resulting from compiling
  CLM at -O3.

  *** NOTE *** The change from -O3 to -O2 has triggered a new xlf11
      compiler problem.  CAM encounters a seg fault when built *without*
      threading enabled, i.e., either serial or pure mpi builds.  The
      workaround is to build for hybrid parallelization, which is the
      default way to build for the IBM power platforms.

. Other Makefile changes for AIX debug mode:
  - change setting of -qinitauto to a double precision signalling NAN
  - turn off the optimization that is implied by -qsmp by setting
    -qsmp=omp:noopt for threaded configs. 

. Various fixes for RRTMG code:
  - bugfix in aerosol optical properties passed to rrtmg
  - change index of the visible band from 9 to 10

. Note that we are not yet ready to start doing tests of RRTMG w/ aerosols
  due to issues with the latest physprop datasets.  Will resolve this in an
  upcoming commit.

. Change the cam*.cpl7.template files to force CCSM builds of CAM to enable
  threading.

One-line Summary: allow setting fcrit2 via namelist; add aerosol optical
depth diagnostics to history output

Purpose of changes:

. Provide a new namelist variable fcrit2 to allow setting the value in
  gw_drag.  The default is still fcrit2=1.0 which is the change made in
  cam3_5_50. 

. Add diagnostic output of the column integrated optical depth in the
  visible band for individual aerosol constituents that affect the climate
  simulation.  The names in the history file are of the form ODV_xxx where
  xxx is the constituent name as set by the parameterization that
  determines its mass distribution.  xxx is also the name that is used in
  the rad_climate namelist variable.

One-line Summary: Enable building standalone CAM with CICE

Purpose of changes:

. In the near future the "prescribed" version of CICE will replace
  CSIM4 as the default sea ice model for the standalone CAM configuration.
  This commit is a step along that path; CICE has not yet been made the
  default.  It is currently enabled by giving the argument "-ice cice" to
  configure.

. Unlike CSIM4, CICE uses its own grid decomposition which is independent
  of CAM's.  This decomposition is specified by parameters that are set at
  build time, hence they are specified to configure.  There are two ways to
  do this:
  - Specify the number of tasks and/or threads for hybrid, pure mpi, or
    pure omp parallelism using the new configure options -ntasks, and
    -nthreads.  This will allow a default decomposition to be determined.
  - Specify the CICE decomposition explicitly via the new configure options 
    -cice_bsizex, -cice_bsizey, and -cice_maxblocks.

. Update the CICE external to cice4_0_20080718

. Modify the Makefile to allow faster compilation of the RRTMG modules
  rrtmg_lw_k_g.f90 and rrtmg_sw_k_g.f90.  Longer term solution is to read the
  data that's stored in these modules from a file.

SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
. update CICE to cice4_0_20080718
. add external for stub sice

models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. add arguments -cice_bsizex, -cice_bsizey, -cice_maxblocks.
  These are used to explicitly set the CICE decomposition.  Note that they
  must be consistent with the number of tasks and threads used to run the
  executable.
. add arguments -ntasks and -nthreads.  If these are both specified then a
  script provided by CICE will be used to generate a default CICE
  decomposition.
  Setting -ntasks > 0 implies -spmd, and setting -nthreads > 0 implies
  -smp.  Serial mode is still set using "-nospmd -nosmp".
. add cice_decomptype to the config definition.  build-namelist needs access to
  it to call the CICE build-namelist

models/atm/cam/bld/config_definition.xml
. add cice_decomptype, ntasks, and nthreads

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
. use the CICE build-namelist
. add -cice_nl argument as a way to pass values to the CICE build-namelist

models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in

  compilation of rrtmg_lw_k_g.f90 and rrtmg_sw_k_g.f90

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cldwat2m.F90
. change names in outfld calls for number concentrations of aerosols to
  avoid a name clash with the mixing ratios output by chemistry.

One-line Summary: fix to runtime bug with pgi compilers; began replacing 
unit 6 flush statements with those using a variable unit number; fix to 
ensure code dependencies are regenerated with each make

Purpose of changes:
any configuration other than adiabatic or ideal physics would die at runtime 
with a segfault in the radiation code, when using the pgi compilers on jaguar 
(version 7.1-6)...this was introduced in cam3_5_54

occasionally, messages from cam were not making it to log files when the coupled 
model would die at runtime...this was due to flush statements improperly using unit 6

bug 787 describes a problem where code could change between makes where dependencies 
may be altered, but make does not regenerate the Depends file

One-line Summary: make MG microphysics the default

Purpose of changes:

. MG microphysics is now the default.  This is controlled by the new
  "-microphys" argument to configure.  The valid values are "rk" (Rasch and
  Kristjansson), and "mg" (Morrison and Gettelman two moment scheme).  "mg"
  is the default.

  ** Note 1 ** This default needs to implemented in configure rather than
               build-namelist because it affects the total number of
               advected constituents which is a build time setting.

  ** Note 2 ** Since configure now knows what microphysics scheme is being
               used, build-namelist is able to automatically set the
               correct value of the namelist variable microp_scheme.  The
               user no longer needs to set that variable.

. Add bugfix to MG microphysics code (from Andrew Gettelman).

. A new argument, -nadv_tt, has been added to configure to specify the
  number of advected test tracers.  Previously this was done by using the
  -nadv argument which specifies the total number of advected tracers.
  That way of doing things resulted in having to redefine all the
  regression tests that include test tracers because the MG microphysics
  adds 2 advected constituents.  Deconvolving the specification of test
  tracers and total advected constituents makes the test specifications
  more robust, and provides an easier to use interface.

. The regression tests have been updated to use the new -nadv_tt argument
  to configure for specifying the number of advected test tracers.  Also,
  the special test for MG microphysics has been replaced by a test for the
  cam3.5 physics.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Add bugfix to MG microphysics code (from Andrew Gettelman).

Describe any changes made to build system:

. configure has 2 new arguments: -microphys and -nadv_tt

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

One-line Summary:  Add new radiative constituent interfaces.  Add RRTMG as
an option.  CAM3.5 configuration is now the default.

Purpose of changes:

. The new radiative constituent interface has been added.  This provides
  for an explicit specification of which constituents are radiatively
  active for both climate and diagnostic calculations.  The namelist
  variables rad_climate, rad_diag_1, rad_diag_2, ... rad_diag_10 are used
  to specify the constituents used for the climate and up to ten diagnostic
  calculations.  Each of the namelist variables specifies which
  constituents are used for the gas species, aerosol species, and a file
  that contains the optical and physical properties for each aerosol species.

  build-namelist constructs default values for rad_climate for each of the
  chemistry options.  There are no diagnostic calculations specified by
  default.  In this initial commit the diagnostic calculations for the CAM3
  radiation code are not implemented.  There is a partial implementation of
  the diagnostics for the RRTMG radiation.

  The functionality for controlling which aerosols were radiatively active
  was previously located in the aerosol_intr module.  The namelist
  variables previously used for this purpose have been removed.

. The RRTMG radiation code is present as a build time option.  It is
  enabled by specifying the flag -rrtmg to configure.  Implementing aerosol
  and cloud optics for RRTMG is not yet complete.

  The RRTMG code is accessed by CAM via an external definition of the 
  source tree directory models/atm/cam/src/physics/rrtmg/ext/

. MG microphysics now gets microphysical data for aerosols from the same
  files that provide the optics data.  This data was previously hardcoded
  in the prescribed_aerosols module.  That module has been removed.

. The 1990_control use case has been made the default configuration on the
  trunk.  This is the configuration used for CCSM3.5 1990 control
  runs.  The differences from the previous default configuration are:
  - The CAM-Chem prescribed aerosols replace the CAM3 aerosol climatology.
  - The GHG values (co2vmr, ch4vmr, n2ovmr, f11vmr, f12vmr) and scon are
    from the 1990_control use case.
  - The CAM-Chem prescribed ozone replaces the CAM3 ozone (from pcmdi).
  - The CAM-Chem options are enabled by making the configure option
    "-chem trop_mozart_prescribed_aero" the default chemistry mode.

. A new chemistry mode "-chem none" has been added to configure.
  Specifying this option turns on the CAM3 prescribed aerosols and ozone
  and makes them radiatively active.  The functionality to support the CAM3
  prescribed aerosols and ozone is implemented by the new cam3_aero_data
  and cam3_ozone_data modules.

. Modifications to CAM-Chem code:
  - The prescribed aerosol and ozone modules were modified to put the
    interpolated values (in mass mixing ratio units) into the physics
    buffer.
  - The namelist variable input has been redistributed so that it's not
    handled entirely by the chemistry module.
  - The names of the prescribed aerosols were changed.
  - Default value of xactive_drydep changed from .false. to .true.
  - More flexible tracer_data module.  Allow dimensions of the input data
    to occur in any order rather than restrict to (lon,lat,lev,tim).

. SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES:
  - update to esmf_wrf_timemgr_080717
  - add external rrtmg_080606

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. The CAM-Chem code that rebins the 4-bin sea salt into 2 bins for the
  CAM-RT optics was missing an initializer.

. The problem with the trop_mozart_ghg_paero mode running in debug mode
  under xlf11 has been fixed.  The problem was with date calculation code
  in tracer_data which has been updated to use time_manager methods (and
  required a mod to the esmf_wrf_timemgr code.

Describe any changes made to build system:

. add -rrtmg flag to configure to build CAM with RRTMG radiation

. modifications to make "trop_mozart_prescribed_aero" the default value of
  the -chem argument to configure

. namelist variables modified
  - bndtvaer: moved from group cam_inparm to cam3_aero_data_nl
  - bndtvo: moved from group cam_inparm to cam3_ozone_data_nl
  - ozncyc: moved from group cam_inparm to cam3_ozone_data_nl

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. the namelist_defaults.xml file has been modified to remove all the
  resolution dependent start_ymd values.  This was origianlly implemented
  to ensure that a default initial file would be found without the user
  needing to know the corresponding date.  This feature was mainly for the
  regression testing.  But we now have the capability to specify
  -ignore_ic_date or -ignore_ic_year to build-namelist which is a more
  explicit and flexible way for the user to indicate that the exact date of
  the initial file isn't important.  The TBL.sh script uses the
  -ignore_ic_date arg in its build-namelist call.

  The result of this change is that some of our regression tests which
  previously got a resolution dependent start_ymd that was different from
  901 will now get the resolution independent default which has been
  changed to 101 for consistency with the CCSM scripts.

These baseline tests are expected to fail due to changed answers.  The
ideal physics and adiabatic configurations in tests bl115, bl334, and bl335
are actually BFB, but the test is failing due to the changes to the default
start_ymd values.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag: cam3_5_52

Summarize any changes to answers:

Model configurations that are BFB with the baseline:
====================================================

. adiabatic and ideal physics

. full physics configurations in which the only radiatively active species
  are the gases.  If prescribed ozone is active, it must be the CAM3
  ozone. The CAM3 ozone is enabled by setting cam3_ozone_data_on=.true. in
  the namelist.  The aerosols are turned off in the baseline code by
  setting sulscl=dustscl=carscl=ssltscl=0.0 in the namelist.

  This was verified for the -chem options: trop_mozart_prescribed_aero,
  trop_mozart_ghg_paero, trop_mozart_aero, trop_mozart, waccm_ghg, and
  waccm_mozart.

Model configurations that have only roundoff differences with the baseline:
===========================================================================

. full physics configurations in which the only radiatively active species
  are the gases *and* the active ozone is the CAM-Chem prescribed ozone.
  This version of ozone is the now the default on the trunk.  The aerosols
  are turned off in the baseline code by setting
  sulscl=dustscl=carscl=ssltscl=0.0 in the namelist.

  This was verified via a pergro test for the -chem option
  trop_mozart_prescribed_aero.

. full physics configurations with CAM-Chem version of aerosols (prescribed
  or prognostic).

  In order to validate the roundoff diffs it is necessary to fix the bug in
  the baseline code that rebins the 4-bin sea salt into 2 bins.

  Configurations that were verified by pergro test are the -chem options:
  trop_mozart_prescribed_aero and trop_mozart_ghg_paero.

Model configurations with larger than roundoff differences from the baseline:
=============================================================================

. full physics configurations using the CAM3 prescribed aerosols.  The
  issue here is that these aerosol mixing ratios were incorrectly treated
  as moist mmr in CAM3 code.  This has been fixed.  The result is larger
  than roundoff differences (but presumably the same climate) have been
  introduced into these configurations.  That includes the waccm_ghg and
  waccm_mozart modes which aren't yet configured to use the new CAM-Chem
  prescribed aerosols.

Validation with MG microphysics enabled:
========================================

. The validation of the default configuration + MG microphysics is
  complicated by very large error growth when MG is enabled.  Our standard
  pergro test is not valid in this configuration.  So to attempt to validate
  MG I looked just at a 6 step run using the pergro/aqua_planet
  configuration, and looked at the output from cprnc for all fields written
  to the default history file.  The roundoff size differences are introduced
  at nstep=0, and it can be seen that all fields with differences show 12-16
  digits of agreement on average.  This isn't a stong test, but it did point
  out problems that resulted in larger than roundoff size differences at
  nstep=0.  In particular, to get this test to pass it was necessary to make
  a bugfix to the baseline code.  In stratiform_tend the conversion of aerosol
  mass to mmr made before calling the MG microphysics was using moist instead
  of dry air mass.

compiler problem; backed out timing library introduced in cam3_5_51; new 
cice tag with prescribed ice similar to csim

Purpose of changes: 
cam3_5_51 introduced a few things needing attention...omp-only mode needed 
a bug fix and posttag testing with pathscale was disabled due to new code 
that triggered a compiler problem...also, running with the ccsm scripts 
showed a problem with the timing library introduced

a new cice tag became available where the prescribed ice looks similar to 
csim...this is the next step on the path to replacing csim with cice

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/par_xsum.F90

  - Replaced existing logic based on "master computes" with the scalable,
    reproducible algorithm implemented in repro_sum_module. If the relative
    difference between the sum produced by the reproducible fixed-point 
    algorithm and by the nonreproducible floating-point algorithm is greater 
    than repro_sum_rel_diff_max  (default 1.0e-13) and if repro_sum_recompute 
    is set equal to true (default .false.), then the sum is recomputed with
    the original (nonscalable) algorithm. Since this is done on a field-by-field
    basis, the memory requirements are less than in the original implementation,
    but the cost is potentially much greater.

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/FVperf_module.F90

  - defined the grid argument in FVstartclock, FVstopclock, and
    FVbarrierclock to be intent(in) instead of intent(inout) when
    GEOS_MODE is NOT defined. This removes an incompatibility introduced by
    using FVstart/stopclock in par_xsum.F90.

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/te_map.F90

  - in previous versions, par_xsum was not called when SPMD was not defined
    or when nprxy_x = 1. To preserve reproducibility when using the repro_sum 
    routine, te_map was modified to call par_xsum in all instances.

One-line Summary: BGP support; new timing library; new 
reproducible sum routine; new performance optimization options
in cd_core; ALTGATHER support; clean-up and bug fixes

Purpose of changes:

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): omega diagnostic calculation
is now correct when geopktrans==1 (and 2)

Describe any changes made to build system: added support for BGP in 
Makefile and in configure. Adding ALTGATHER to CPPFLAGS may
eliminate the gather failure on the Cray XT without requiring setting
MPI environment variables.

Describe any changes made to the namelist: eliminated 
phys_float_repro_gmean, phys_fixed_repro_gmean, and 
phys_nonrepro_gmean; replaced phys_rdiff_warning_gmean with
repro_sum_rel_diff_max; added repro_sum_recompute, 
geopkblocks, and cd_core_swapm; added option 2 to geopktrans.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: performance improved 
for certain problems and platforms by setting geopktrans=2 and
geopkblocks appropriately, and/or by setting cd_core_swapm to .true.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

Timing library
  Updated to include a more recent version of Jim Rosinski's
  GPTL library, supporting global statistics, and improved control of 
  output

  M SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES
    - updated to timing/trunk_tags/timing080629

  M models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
    - added OpenMP-enabling flags to CFLAGS when SMP is defined
      for all platforms where missing. Note that have tested only
      on Bluefire, Bangkok, Cray XT4 (Jaguar), and IBM BG/P

ALTGATHER
  Defining ALTGATHER replaces mpi_gather in mpigatherv with a point-to-point
  implementation with additional flow control. It also calls new routines
  mp_sendirr_fc, mp_sendirr_fc_r4, and mp_sendirr_fc_i4 with additional
  flow control for gathers in FV I/O routines. This avoids many of the gather
  failures on the Cray XT. These may become unecessary when PIO becomes
  operational, but this approach is more robust than using MPI environment
  variables to avoid the gather error.

  M models/utils/pilgrim/mod_comm.F90
    - added mp_sendirr_fc, mp_sendirr_fc_r4, mp_sendirr_fc_i4

  M models/atm/cam/src/control/binary_io.F90
  M models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_grid.F90
  M models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_history.F90
    - call mpigathervr4 and mpigathervint instead of mpigatherv when
      gathering r4 and int data, respectively

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/io_dist.F90
    - if ALTGATHER defined, call mp_sendirr_fc, 
      mp_sendirr_fc_r4 and mp_sendirr_fc_i4 instead of
      mp_sendirr, mp_sendirr_fc and mp_sendirr_fc, respectively

  M models/atm/cam/src/control/wrap_mpi.F90
    - added new routines mpigathervr4 and mpigathervint; if ALTGATHER
      defined, use point-to-point implementations of the gather
      with flow control in mpigatherv, mpigathervr4, and migathervint
      instead of MPI_GATHERV

BG/P support:
  M models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
    - added BGP section that works on ORNL BGP system; have not yet tried
      on ANL BGP system
  M models/atm/cam/bld/configure
    - added bgp as -target_os option
  M models/atm/cam/src/utils/abortutils.F90
    - added BGP to existing BGL ifdef
  M models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/zm_conv_intr.F90
    - BGP compiler bug workaround (having to do with an
      optional parameter). Enabled only if BGP defined.

Reproducible distributed sum
  Extracted fixed-precision algorithm from phys_gmean and put into
  a new module. New algorithm can be used with any distributed sum, not
  just a global mean. Both fixed-precision and floating-point algorithms 
  are now always computed, and the relative difference is
  returned in an optional parameter. The error tolerance 
  repro_sum_rel_diff_max is used in the calling routine (phys_gmean here)
  to decide whether to just write out a warning message or to also
  recompute using the original "master computes" nonscalable algorithm. 
  The recalculation occurs in phys_gmean if the namelist parameter 
  repro_sum_recompute is set to .true.

  M models/atm/cam/src/control/runtime_opts.F90
    - eliminated phys_float_repro_gmean, phys_fixed_repro_gmean, 
      phys_nonrepro_gmean, and phys_rdiff_warning_gmean ; added
      repro_sum_rel_diff_max and repro_sum_recompute

  M models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_gmean.F90
    - replaced in-place algorithm with call to repro_sum
    - deleted public routines phys_gmean_defaultopts, phys_gmean_setopts, 
      and private routine gmean_nonrepro

  M models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_grid.F90
    - made nlcols public for use in phys_gmean

Alternative GEOPK routine
  The calculation of geopotential to the kappa (geopk) is one of the 
  more expensive operators in the FV dycore when using a 2D domain
  decomposition as it requires transposing from a YZ to an
  XY decompostion and back again for each call. An existing
  non-transpose-based alternative algorithm (geopk16) is not 
  reproducible unless quad precision is used, which is not 
  available on a number of platforms, such as the Cray XT. 
  A new optional algorithm, geopk_d, has been introduced that does 
  not require a transpose and is reproducible without requiring 
  quad precision. Performance using geopk_d is sometimes better 
  (and sometimes worse) than the other options. geopk_d
  is enabled by setting the namelist parameter geopktrans
  to 2. (Setting it to 0, the default, enbles geopk; setting it to 1 
  enables geopk16.) A tuning parameter geopkblocks is used with geopk_d 
  to define the amount of overlap to try to exploit in this 
  distributed algorithm. The default is 1 (no overlap), while the 
  optimal choice appears to be approximately 3 when using large 
  latitude decompositions. However, the optimum is dependent on problem 
  size, processor count, and platform. In the process of introducing
  this option, it was discovered that the non-transpose-based options
  were no longer working due to the reworking of the omega calculation.
  This has been fixed.

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/geopk.F90
    - added geopk_d

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/cd_core.F90
    - added call to geopk_d and bug fix

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/dyn_comp.F90
    - distributed algorithm bug fix

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/dynamics_vars.F90
  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/spmd_dyn.F90
    - added support for geopk_d

  M models/atm/cam/src/control/runtime_opts.F90
    - added geopkblocks namelist parameter

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/eul/spmd_dyn.F90
  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/spmd_dyn.F90
  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/sld/spmd_dyn.F90
    - added geopkblocks to spmd_dyn_defaultopts and 
      spmd_dyn_setopts

Alternative transpose algorithm
  A major source of communication overhead in FV when using
  the 2D decomposition is the transposes between the YZ and XY
  decompositions. The current Pilgrim/mod_comm implementation
  supports both one-sided and two-sided MPI communication, and
  both explicit buffer packing and MPI datatypes. Every effort
  is made to overlap communication with computation by separating
  the commands mp_sendirr and mp_recvirr. As an evaluation tool,
  an alternative mechanism called mp_swapmirr has been introduced 
  that uses the swapm routine. mp_swapmirr gives up 
  the one-sided and MPI data type options and does not try to
  overlap the communication. but it does enable
  trying many different two-sided communication protocols, uses
  a more efficient communication ordering, and has the ability
  to transpose multiple fields simultaneously. This capability is
  introduced initially into cd_core only, and is enabled by
  setting the namelist parameter cd_core_swapm to .true.
  Initial experiments indicate that mp_swapmirr is sometimes 
  more efficient. If this holds upon further investigation, 
  the relevant functionality will either be introduced 
  into the standard mod_comm routines or the new routine
  will be used outside of cd_core as well.

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/cd_core.F90
    - added call to mp_swapmirr

  M models/utils/pilgrim/mod_comm.F90
    - added mp_swapmirr

    - added support for mp_swapmirr (cd_core_swapm)

  M models/atm/cam/src/utils/spmd_utils.F90
    - added communicator argument to swapm (so that could
      be used in FV); added optional parameters to override
      communication protocol defaults
    - changed default protocol to mpi_isend/mpi_irevc
      (from mpi_sendrecv) as a general performance optimization

  M models/atm/cam/src/control/wrap_mpi.F90
    - added communicator argument to swapm

  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/eul/spmd_dyn.F90
  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/homme/spmd_dyn.F90
  M models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/sld/spmd_dyn.F90
    - added cd_core_swapm to spmd_dyn_defaultopts and 
      spmd_dyn_setopts

Date: 12 June 2008
One-line Summary: added support for new machine bluefire; enabled 
create_newcase (of the ccsm scripts) to be called from within cam;
added code work-around for older pgi compilers

Purpose of changes: 
bluefire (the new IBM clustered system at NCAR based on the Power6 chip) 
came online june 9th and blueice will be taken offline around june 16

we wanted the ability to do model runs from cam using the ccsm 
scripts in order to benefit from the features these scripts offer, like: 
swapping in other component models (like replacing csim for cice), 
use of the ccsm run database to document model runs, etc. 

fix that went into cam3_5_48 corrected problems for pgi and pathscale 
compilers as well as ifort, but not older versions (6.1-6) of pgi used 
on cgd machines bangkok and calgary; a code work-around was added to 
enable posttag testing on those machines while we wait for a compiler 
upgrade

One-line Summary: test scripts updated for new jaguar hardware and compilers;
updated to new clm,mct and scripts externals to address bugs; other bug fixes

Purpose of changes:
jaguar returned to production with new quad-core processors - the test 
scripts needed mods to work with the new hardware and pgi compilers (7.1-6)

a new mct tag was released that addressed several cam bugs - one with fv 
decomp and phys_loadbalance=0 on jaguar and the other with excessive writes 
from processors other than the master

a new clm tag addressed a bug in logic for do-albedo calculation

numerous ccsm tests were failing due to bugs in the scripts used by the coupled 
system, including a mismatch in the grids specified for the eul dycore

new default aquaplanet initial files added to help in running pergro tests

One-line Summary: build-namelist mods

Purpose of changes:

. fix bug in waccm_1995_climo use case

. update the Build::NamelistDefinition module with methods for creating
  documentation from the definition xml file

. extend build-namelist to write the /modelio/ namelists used by components
  to redirect their log output to a named file.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
. fixed bug in waccm_1995_climo use case

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. add namelist variables used by components to redirect their log output to
  named files.  The new variables are

  atm_logfile      - Name of file that the atmosphere component log messages will
                     be written to.  Default: none
  atm_logfile_diro - Absolute pathname of directory that the file specified
                     by atm_logfile will be written to.  Default: "./"
  cpl_logfile      - Name of file that the driver component log messages will
                     be written to.  Default: none
  cpl_logfile_diro - Absolute pathname of directory that the file specified
                     by cpl_logfile will be written to.  Default: "./"
  lnd_logfile      - Name of file that the land component log messages will
                     be written to.  Default: none
  lnd_logfile_diro - Absolute pathname of directory that the file specified
                     by lnd_logfile will be written to.  Default: "./"

  Having each component write to it's own named log file is the default
  when running with the ccsm4_alpha scripts.  These new variables allow the
  same flexibility when running with the standalone CAM scripts.  The
  default for the standalone CAM scripts remains that all components write
  their log messages to stdout.

One-line Summary: misc mods for build, trop_mozart_prescribed_aero, cam-som

Purpose of changes:

. build-namelist mods:
  - when user specifies ncdata require that start_ymd also be specified
  - don't write dom namelist when ocn=none.  similarly for csim when
    ice=none. 

. configure mods:
  - don't put utils/timing in filepath for build using ccsm scripts (they
    build the timing lib separately)

. Modify behavior of "-chem trop_mozart_prescribed_aero".  This option has
  been changed to allow one to use the prescribed mozart ozone via the
  "prescribed_ozone_file" namelist option.  If "prescribed_ozone_file" is
  not set then the default cam ozone data is used for the radiation
  calculation, just as before.

. Modify DOM so that it writes TSOCN to CAM's initial file.  This is needed
  for CAM-SOM.

. Add ENDOFRUN option to the inithist namelist variable.  This allows an
  initial file to be written only at the end of the run.
  :N.B. this option won't be fully functional until mods are made to 
        CLM and to the driver code.

One-line Summary: Advect tracers simultaneously and allow finer decomp. with FV

Purpose of changes: Several issues are addressed:

A. Ability to advect multiple tracers simultaneously with FV

Tracers may be divided into "trac_decomp" groups, with trac2d invoked
concurrently for the various groups. The additional groups are solved
using auxiliary computational processes. In particular, the kth group of
tracers is advected on the kth set of npes_yz processs. The relevant
namelist variable is trac_decomp, whose default is 1. The implementation
of this option is very similar to that of overlapping trac2d and
cd_core subcycles; however, these options are presently mutually exclusive.

B. Ability to use larger FV domain decomposition

The condition that a subdomain contain 3 vertical lines has been relaxed.
Subdomains need contain at least one vertical line.

C. Bug fix and minor modification to mod_comm

A bug was discovered that affects scenarios with more than 1024 processes
ONLY WHEN at least one of the modcomm_?? namelist variables equals 1.
This was remedied by changing some static arrays to allocatable.

Also, the quantity "alloc_slack_factor" was changed to 8, to accommodate
certain fine-domain-decomposition scenarios.

D. Allow new 64-bit netCDF format

This is necessary for some high-resolution scenarios. The relevant
namelist variable is use_64bit_nc, which defaults as .false.

E. Incorporate minor modification and bug fix from MVR

Bug fix involves use with PGI.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Mod_comm bug (see item C above) and Makefile.in bug (see item E above).

One-line Summary: brought cam up to date with ccsm4_0_alpha25 driver 

Purpose of changes: To bring the ccsm4_0_alpha25 cam branch and other
	ccsm4_0_alpha25 externals (primarily the drvseq2_0_10 driver) onto
	the cam trunk. The cam "stand-alone" configuration (for both
	cam/dom and cam/som) will always be run with the new driver
	"ocean_tight_coupling" namelist option set to .true. The ocean
	tight coupling option treats ocean model like lnd/ice in
	coupling. When this is true, the updated state from the ocean is
	merged with the updated state from the land and ice to create the
	input atmospheric state. The updated state from the ocean is also
	used in the atm/ocn flux calculation. When this is not true
	(i.e. loose coupling) the previous state of the ocean is used
	along with the updated state from the land and ice to be merged
	into the input atmosphere. In addition, the previous state of the
	ocean is used in the atm/ocn flux calculation too. Loose coupling
	is the way pop2 is always coupled into the system and corresponds
	to the way a concurrent ocean would be run.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:  modified configure to 
	add new flexibility to bring in cice (which is
	not the default yet) and added COUP_DOM as a CPP variable.

Describe any changes made to the namelist: driver namelist modifications

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: the following
	sst datasets are now the defaults (since they have the correct
	time and calendar attributes to run with the cice in prescribed mode)

. fix prodprec (prain) variable [changes answers only with prognostic aerosols]
. additional mod: put prodsnow and evapsnow into prain, evaprain
  [changes answers only with prognostic aerosols: this fixes the
   wet-deposition]

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/mcshallow.F90
. In compute_mcshallow change the initializers for cnt_out to 1 and for
  cnb_out to pver.  Only do it in the last of the 4 places where the
  cnt_out/cnb_out values are set.  This appears to be the section of code
  that re-initializes values for columns with no convection.

Summarize any changes to answers: BFB except when MG microphysics is on
  due to bug fixes in that code.

  Andrew has verified this code is reasonable both with our microphysical
  diagnostics and with the standard diagnostics.

  Diagnostics at:
  http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/andrew/diag/nmicro2.65_cam3_5_36-obs/

  Diagnostics for a pair of 2 year runs with the
  fixed version (nmicro2.68) and the current version on the trunk
  (cam3_5_36_MG) are at:

  http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/andrew/diag/cam3_5_36_MG-nmicro2.68_cam3_5_36

  Note that both of these are with the Morrison-Gettelman microphysics.

One-line Summary: bug fixes for build-namelist

Purpose of changes:

. Bug fixes for build-namelist -- see below.

. Reimplement the -test option to build-namelist.  This checks whether the
  input datasets exist on the local disk.  It's also an easy way to
  generate a list of the input datasets required for the run.

. Allow the phys_debug_util module to read its own namelist.  The
  implementation is meant to serve as an example for other modules for
  which it's appropriate to read namelist input.  The general design that
  we've been moving towards is for modules to read their own namelist
  rather than have all namelist variables live in one big namelist.  The
  new build-namelist utility makes it easy to define a new namelist group
  and have that namelist group be written to the atm_in file simply by
  adding an appropriate definition of the variables in the
  namelist_definition.xml file.  

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. build-namelist wasn't validating namelist array variables that were specified
  in the input as array elements.

. build-namelist was not recognizing values in the -namelist argument when
  the string contained embedded newlines.  This happens when using the C
  shell and splitting the -namelist arg into multiple lines.

. build-namelist wasn't checking the date attributes in the default values
  for finidat.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. phys_debug_lat and phys_debug_lon have moved to the new namelist group
  phys_debug_nl.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: none

List all subroutines added and what they do: none

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

models/atm/cam/bld/build-namelist
. modify so that when a new namelist group is defined for the CAM
  component that group will automatically be written to CAM's namelist
  file. 
. fix setting the default value of finidat to recognize the date
  attribute. 
models/atm/cam/bld/namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml
. move phys_debug_lat and phys_debug_lon into namelist group phys_debug_nl
models/atm/cam/bld/perl5lib/Build/NamelistDefinition.pm
. modify the _validate_pair method so that an index specifier is stripped
  off of the variable name before checking whether it's in the definition
  file.
models/atm/cam/bld/perl5lib/Build/Namelist.pm
. allow strings used to initialize Namelist objects to contain embedded
  newlines.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/phys_debug_util.F90
. add subroutine phys_debug_readnl to read the namelist.
models/atm/cam/src/control/runtime_opts.F90
. remove phys_debug_lat, phys_debug_lon from cam_inparm
. add call to phys_debug_readnl

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/convect_shallow.F90
. add CLDTOP and CLDBOT to master field list for debugging.

One-line Summary: enable test_driver for jaguar (cray xt); now pulling in 
entire ccsm scripts directory as external; mod to allow communication with 
flux coupler every cam timestep
	
Purpose of changes:
there was a need to perform regular cam testing on jaguar as reliance
on this machine for production use increases 

a bug fix was added to the archiving scripts, so the external for 
its scripts tag needed updating...we eventually will need the ccsm 
scripts available as the two systems merge, so we decided to pull 
in the entire ccsm scripts directory as the external

a fix was needed in ccsm_msg.F90 to match a corresponding correction 
in the flux coupler to correctly specify the albedo shift and enable 
communication every cam timestep

One-line Summary: new version of build-namelist

Purpose of changes:

. A new version of build-namelist has been implemented with new features
  which will make namelist generation more robust, as well as being easier
  to extend and maintain.

  From the user perspective the biggest differences with the old version
  are: 

  - All valid namelist variables are known to build-namelist.  So an
    incorrectly specified variable from the user (supplied either by the
    -infile or -namelist options) will cause build-namelist to fail with an
    error message telling which namelist variable is invalid.  This is a
    big improvement over a runtime failure caused by an invalid variable
    which typically gives no hint as to which variable caused the problem.

  - In addition to knowing all valid variable names and their types,
    build-namelist also knows which namelist group each variable belongs
    to.  This means that the user only needs to specify variable names to
    build-namelist and not the group names.  The -infile and -namelist
    options still require valid namelist syntax as input.  But the group
    name(s) is ignored.  So all variables can be put in a single group with
    an arbitrary name, for example, "&in ... /".

  From the developer perspective the main differences are:

  - New namelist variables added to existing namelist groups require adding
    an entry to the definition file (namelist_definition.xml).  If the new
    variable has default values these are provided by modifying the
    build-namelist script and possibly the defaults file
    (namelist_defaults_cam.xml).

  - Implementing a new namelist group no longer requires writing a new perl
    module.  The variables are added following the same procedure used to
    add a variable to an existing namelist group.

  The commandline interface to build-namelist has not been changed except
  to remove the -cam_cfg option.  This was used to specify the directory
  containing the CAM configuration files.  It's not needed because we
  assume the files are located in directories relative to the one that
  contains the build-namelist script being executed (which is known by
  looking at $0).

  The -test option has not yet been implemented.

  The -v (verbose) option no longer accepts a value.  It's an on switch.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

One-line Summary: bug fixes for MG microphysics, aerosol optics, & misc

| 24 Jan 2008, eaton, update ChangeLog for cam3_5_29 
|
| Andrew Conley let me know that the indexing bug in aer_optics.F90
| shouldn't affect the default physics because in the original prescribed
| aerosols the longwave effect of seasalt and dust was zero.  I verified
| this.  The ChangeLog documention has been updated accordingly.

Purpose of changes:

. Bug fixes and diagnostics changes for MG microphysics.  Also changed some
  diagnostics from RK microphysics.  Only affects simulations with MG
  microphysics turned on.

. Fix indexing bug in aer_optics.F90 which affects simulations where the
  new seasalt and dust aerosols are radiatively active.

. Add fix or workaround (not sure which) for a problem with the pgi
  compiler on jaguarcnl.  Compiler is failing on a declaration of a zero
  size array which uses a scalar initializer.

. Change entropy function (in zm_conv.F90) to return a real(r8) result.  It
  was returning a single precision result.  This results in a larger than
  roundoff difference in the simulations with default physics.

  Also replace the stop with an endrun call in the convergence checking
  loop of subroutine ientropy (in zm_conv.F90).


Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. bugz #683 - fix for single column output (was broken when making memory
              use improvements in cam3_5_26).

One-line Summary: refactor the adiabatic and ideal physics options

Purpose of changes:

. The ideal physics mode was broken when using the FV dycore.  The
  process of fixing that configuration inspired a refactoring of the
  implementation of both adiabatic and ideal physics modes for all
  dycores.  The main features of the refactoring are:
  - The dry atmosphere is implemented by setting the specific humidity to
    zero rather than by setting physical constants for water vapor to
    those for dry air.  The Q field is no longer required on the initial
    file for these modes.
  - The condensed water species are no longer allocated and transported
    around as inert species.
  - The FV dycore is not called in a special mode but is called the same
    way as when full physics forcings are applied.
  - The adiabatic and ideal physics forcings are returned as tendencies and
    applied to the state in the identical way that full physics forcings
    are applied.
  - The energy conservation for the FV dycore which is done in the physics
    part of the code is now done in adiabatic and ideal modes identically
    to how it's done in full physics mode.
  - Eliminate write/read of fields from restart files that aren't used in
    ideal/adiabatic modes.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
#677 - don't turn on co2 cycle code for CCSM_BGC==CO2A

Describe any changes made to build system:

. add "ideal" and "adiabatic" as valid values of configure's -phys option.
  The reason for making adiabatic and ideal physics build time options is
  that the condensed water species need not be allocated and transported
  for these dry atmosphere configurations.  For either of these physics
  options only one advected specie is allocated (by default).

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. No namelist variables changed.  But since the adiabatic and ideal physics
  modes are specified to configure, build-namelist knows about these modes
  and can automatically add the appropriate namelist variable, i.e., either
  setting atm_ideal_phys=.true. or atm_adiabatic=.true..  So the use does
  not need to worry about setting a namelist variable for adiabatic or
  ideal physics modes.

One-line Summary:
CAM will now couple to the surface components every CAM time step in a way 
that mirrors the coupling mechanism in cpl6; orbital parameter orb_iyear_ad 
will now default to 1990 rather than 1950.

Purpose of changes:
This new coupling mechanism also solves the current problem whereby history 
files were not obtained in the last month of production runs. Now when cam 
and the surface components couple every cam time step, cam and clm do not 
communicate with the driver at nstep=0. Backwards compatibility was maintained 
to still permit the coupling of cam with the surface components on the cam 
radiation time step. The cam tests now use coupling every time step as the 
default approach.
Orbital parameter now matches that used in CCSM.

Purpose of changes: Memory usage reduction

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:
  The pflds array of cam_history.F90 was replaced by a linked list.  This  
  allows the masterlist to be allocated as needed instead of statically allocated
  to the largest anticipated size.  The hash table lookup feature of outfld is retained 
  by creating an array of pointers into the linked list.  The sum result is a slight reduction of 
  performance of the outfld subroutine with up to 2x reduction in memory high water as measured on 
  bluevista.  

Code reviewed by: Brian Eaton

List all subroutines eliminated:

List all subroutines added and what they do:
  add_entry_to_master - add an entry to the masterlist
  init_masterlinkedlist - initialize the linkedlist
  get_entry_by_name - lookup a masterlist entry by name


List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:
  cam_history.F90 - modified to remove pflds from masterlist and from tape structures
                  these are now allocated structures.  pflds is now only used to support
                  reading fincl and fexcl from the namelist and has been reduced from 10000
                  to 500. Changes required moving location of the variable varid in the restart
                  file, so there is a change in restart file format from previous versions.
  cam_comp.F90 - call the init_masterlinkedlist function on startup

One-line Summary: misc bugfixes

Purpose of changes:

. Merge bugfixes from the ccsm35 branch (between tags ccsm35_03_cam3_5_07
  and ccsm35_12_cam3_5_07) onto the trunk.  

  These fixes change answers for the following CAM configurations.
  - All WACCM configurations
  - CAM-CHEM configurations "-chem trop_mozart" and "-chem
    trop_mozart_aero" with the prognostic dust radiatively passive and the
    old prescribed dust radiatively active.

. Makefile.in change in AIX section to support new timing library.

. Update the 1870-2000_control use case to use the version of prescribed
  aerosol datasets that contains 10-year climatologies.

. Update to the CAM-CHEM time interpolation codes to deal with input
  datasets that contain gaps in a time series of monthly averages.

. Change the check on the sum of cell areas when running with cpl6 from an
  absolute to a relative error check.

. Loosen check in interpolate_data module for what percent of interpolated
  grid points fall outside the range of the data points.  This check was
  causing a 31 level model version to fail when interpolating the
  noaamisc.r8.nc file for simple GHG chemistry.

. Bugfix in co2_data_flux module (missing mpibcast).


Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Bugzilla id 667 - Fix iyear_ad bug in WACCM.

. WACCM bugfix for H2O saturation table.

. CAM-CHEM bug in old prescribed dust optics as described above.

Tag name: cam3_5_23
Originator(s): Art Mirin

One-line Summary: Overlap of dynamics and tracer FV subcycles

Purpose of changes:
This version supports overlap of trac2d and cd_core subcycles. This refers to the
subcycles described by the "do 2000 n=1,n2" loop in dyn_run and has nothing to do
with the "do it=1,nsplit" lower-level subcycling. Each trac2d call (n), other
than the last, is overlapped with the subsequent cd_core 'series' (n+1).

This capability becomes relevant as we go to higher and higher resolution and
operate with more and more tracers. Best results are obtained when the dynamics
and tracer times are comparable (for example, operating with more than the default
number of tracers) and when there is a high degrees of subcycling (for example, at
0.47x0.63 with nspltrac=8).

The controlling namelist variable is ct_overlap. The overlapping trac2d calls are
carried out on the second set of npes_yz processes (npes_yz <= iam < 2*npes_yz).
The tracer arrays are sent to the auxiliary processes prior to the do-2000 loop.
During each subcycle (other than the last), the dp0 array is sent prior to the
cd_core series; arrays cx, cy, mfx, mfy are sent directly from cd_core during
the last call in the series (it=nsplit). At the completion of the last auxiliary
trac2d subcycle (n=n2-1), the updated tracer values are returned to the primary
processes; the last tracer subcycle (n=n2) is carried out on the primary processes.
Communication calls are nonblocking, with attempt to overlap computation to the
extent possible. The CCSM mpi layer (wrap_mpi) is used. Tags with values greater
than npes_xy are chosen to avoid possible interference between the messages sent
from cd_core and the geopk-related transpose messages called from cd_core
thereafter. The auxiliary processes must use values of jfirst, jlast, kfirst,
klast corresponding to their primary process antecedents, whereas by design
those values are (1,0,1,0), resp. (set in spmdinit_dyn). We therefore add
auxiliary subdomain limits to the grid datatype: jfirstct, jlastct, kfirstct,
klastct. For the primary processes, these are identical to the actual subdomain
limits; for the secondary processes, these correspond to the subdomain limits of
the antecedent primary process. These values are communicated to the auxiliary
processes during initialization (spmd_vars_init). During the auxiliary
calculations (and allocations) we temporarily set jfirst equal to jfirstct, etc.,
and when done, restore to the original values. Other information needed by the
auxiliary processes is obtained through the grid datatype.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
New variable ct_overlap (default 0). If nonzero, overlap cd_core and trac2d
subcycles as desdribed above; if nonzero, do not overlap. When overlapping,
the number of processes must be at least as large as twice the size of the
latitude-vertical decomposition.

One-line Summary: Addition of Rayleigh friction and Putman filtering (FV)

Purpose of changes:

CAM has been augmented with the capability to apply Rayleigh
friction or additional filtering (FV). The purpose is to counteract
the effects of a polar jet that appears in the upper portions
of the model, particularly at higher resolution. The jet, the 
extent of which is believed to be non-physical and progressively
worse as the resolution increases, can force the model to run at
a prohibitively low time step.

Additionally, an update to the Pilgrim parutilitiesmodule.F90,
courtesy of John Dennis, is included. The purpose of the
update is to reduce memory requirements. This is needed
particularly for running on BG/L at moderate to high resolution.

Also included in this update is pointing model/drv/seq_mct to 
drvseq1_0_56.

Rayleigh friction: Frictional term is applied with an adjustable
vertical profile based on hyperbolic tangent; lost kinetic energy
is converted to potential energy. Namelist variables are as follows:
   rayk0 - vertical index of peak (default 2).
   raykrange - determines width of profile; if 0., default width
      is chosen; see rayleigh_friction.F90.
   raytau0 - approximate decay time (days) at top of model;
      default of 0. means no Rayleigh friction.

Filtering: Capability to optionally filter intermediate c-grid winds,
courtesy of Bill Putman. Majority of code changes due to necessity
of computing c-grid winds before call to c_sw. Namelist variable is:
   filtcw - yes (1), no (0). Default is 0.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

New namelist variables are (for Rayleigh friction) rayk0, raykrange and
raytau0; and (for Putman filtering) filtcw. See above for descriptions.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

average value of a constant value instead of the constant value for CO2 
and O2.

One-line Summary: introduction of scalable gmean algorithms; 
replacement of gavglook by gmean_mass (which calls gmean)
	
Purpose of changes: improve performance and memory scalability of
field mean calculations in the physics

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: cam_inparm (in atm_in)
has optional parameters phys_float_repro_gmean, phys_fixed_repro_gmean, 
phys_nonrepro_gmean, phys_rdiff_warning_gmean (see descriptions below)

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: for large processor counts, 
significant improvement in performance

Code reviewed by: Worley and Eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: 

 gavglook (in physpkg.F90)
 - replaced by gmean_mass

List all subroutines added and what they do: 

 phys_gmean_defaultopts (in phys_gmean.F90)
 - get default phys_gmean runtime options

 phys_gmean_setopts (in phys_gmean.F90)
 - set phys_gmean runtime options

 gmean_mass (in phys_gmean.F90)
 - compute global mean mass of constituent fields on physics decomposition
 - replacement for gavglook; calls gmean

 gmean_float_repro (in phy_gmean.F90 - private to module)
 - gmean algorithm used in cam3_5_16 (preserved until future clean-up check-in)
 - implementation calls gather_chunk_to_field and computes 2D mean on masterproc
 - selected by setting phys_float_repro_gmean = .true. in cam_inparm namelist
 - if selected, this value is used instead of that produced by other gmean
    algorithms

 gmean_fixed_repro (in phy_gmean.F90 - private to module)
 - fixed-point-based, scalable, reproducible gmean algorithm 
 - implementation calls mpi_allreduce twice
 - on by default, but can be turned on/off by setting 
    phys_fixed_repro_gmean = .true./.false. in cam_inparm namelist

 gmean_nonrepro (in phy_gmean.F90 - private to module)
 - floating-point-based, scalable, nonreproducible gmean algorithm 
 - implementation calls mpi_allreduce once
 - on by default, but can be turned on/off by setting 
    phys_nonrepro_gmean = .true./.false. in cam_inparm namelist
 - when used with gmean_fixed_repro, result from gmean_nonrepro used only
    to check that gmean_fixed_repro result is accurate; error criterion
    set using phys_rdiff_warning_gmean mac_inparm namelist. Default value is 
    phys_rdiff_warning_gmean = 1.e-13_r8

One-line Summary: bug fix for gensom utility (temporary); cleanup of 
getfil routine; line length bug fix for code entered in prev tag; new 
resolutions for ocnfrac input files

Purpose of changes: the gensom utility broke with cam3_5_01 where 
the string variables passed between components were being truncated 
when the max length was exceeded - a temporary fix, extending the 
length of the strings was put into the drv code...the getfil routine 
still had logic trying to locate files remotely if not present on 
local disc - this should have been cleaned up with cam3_5_11...lines 
of fortran code cannot exceed 132 chars on tempest compilers - new 
code from cam3_5_15 needed to be split into two lines

.  Memory use in the FV core was reduced by eliminating the allocation of 4
   unnecessary 3D arrays in inidat.

.  Memory use was reduced when absorptivity/emissivity restart files are
   read/written by breaking the read and write of the abs/ems arrays into
   smaller pieces so no more than a single 3D global array of temporary
   storage is required.  Previously PLEVP 3D arrays were being

Purpose of changes: it's been a long-time desire to make the archiving

ideally, we'd like both systems to use the same scripts; this should 
allow for adding support for more machines and storage systems, inside

One-line Summary: Enable different numbers of processes for different portions of the calculation

Purpose of changes: Improve scalability and make minor changes to physics
tuning for 0.5-deg and 0.25-deg FV.

CAM is now able to utilize different numbers of processes for different
portions of the calculation. More specifically:

(1) CAM/FV can run with a smaller latitude-vertical decomposition than
longitude-latitude decomposition.

(2) CAM can run with more physics processes than dynamics processes, or with
inactive processes. Inactive physics processes are enabled by assigning zero chunks.
The current restrictions are as follows: If phys_loadbalance equals 0 or 3, then the
physics process count will equal the dynamics process count, and additional processes will be
idle throughout. If phys_loadbalance equals 2, all processes will be assigned to
the physics and a prescribed subset to the dynamics. The current capability holds for FV,
EUL and SLD dynamical cores.

Also, a few physics tuning parameters relevant to running the FV dycore at
0.5-deg or finer have been modified. 

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist: added nspltrac, dyn_npes, dyn_npes_stride
nspltrac: number of tracer timesteps per physics timestep for FV; if 0,
resolution-dependent defaults are enacted
dyn_npes: number of dynamics processes for EUL/SLD
dyn_npes_stride: stride for dynamics processes for EUL/SLD

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: ability to use more physics
than dynamics processes improves throughput of physics; ability to use more
lon-lat processes than lat-vert processes for FV improves throughput of parts of FV dynamics

One-line Summary: add Morrison-Gettleman microphysics code; 2-bin sea salt optics

Purpose of changes:

. The Morrison-Gettleman microphysics code has been added as an option to
  replace the default Rasch-Kristjansson microphysics.  To enable this
  option:
  -- configure must add 2 additional constituents.  If no other optional
     constituents are enabled then the number of constituents needs to be
     increased from its default value of 3 to 5 via setting the configure 
     arg "-nadv 5".
  -- set the namelist variable microp_scheme='MG'

. An option to produce radiation fields used to diagnose the indirect
  effect has been added.  It is off by default.  To enable it set the
  namelist variable indforce=.true.

. The aerosol optics for sea salt has been changed to use 2 sea salt size
  bins.  The previous sea salt optics assumed only 1 bin.  This results in
  larger than roundoff changes to the climate simulation.

. Add restart and baseline tests to the regression suite for running with
  the MG microphysics enabled.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: added microp_scheme and indforce

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: 

. add default CLM fsurdat files for 0.23x0.31 and 0.47x0.63 resolutions

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none (new microphysics
  not on by default)

These are the expected results.  The baseline tests fail due to the change
in the sea salt optical treatment.  The SLD branch test failures are a
pre-existing problem.

10 year runs were done (by Andrew Gettleman) with cam3_5_04 and
nmicro2_3_cam3_5_04 in their default configurations.  The only difference
between these runs is the treatment of sea salt optical properties (use 2
size bins instead of 1).  The output from the AMWG diagnostics package is

One-line Summary: increase max number of history fields; modify
  tracer_suite; add namelist utility; fix cyclic mode

Purpose of changes:

. Increase size of master field list.  This was needed to allow running a
  CCSM configuration that turns on full trop_mozart chemistry.

  Also made a couple of changes to eliminate adding names to the master
  field list that have no corresponding outfld calls.

. Fix a bug in trop_mozart data reading code.  This affects performance but
  the answers are identical.

. Modifications to the tracers_suite module to allow easily creating many
  test tracers.  The original 5 tracers (which have no emission, source, or
  sink terms) are copied as many time as necessary to produce the requested
  number of test tracers.

  This option is used by setting the configure -nadv option to the total
  number of advected tracers, and by setting the namelist variable
  tracers_flag=.true.  The total number of test tracers will be the number
  set by the -nadv option, minus the number present by default (the water
  substance tracers) and the number registered by any other packages.

. Utility code has been added which will position an input file at the
  first record of a specified namelist group.  This simplifies reading a
  specific namelist from an input file that contains multiple namelists.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): #563

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: 

. The size of the history master field list was increased.
. The size of the primary hash table for the master field list was
  increased.

  Note that the primary reason these data array sizes need to be increased
  is that there are 10 or so diagnostic fields that occur for each
  constituent, and they are registered in the master list whether the
  diagnostic is being computed or not.  Better control logic needs to be
  added to the diagnostic code so that these fields are not registered in
  the master list unless the diagnostic is going to be computed and written
  to a history file.

. use subroutine find_group_name from new namelist_utils module to find the
  cam_inparm namelist group in the input file.

. comment out addfld calls for per constituent diagnostics of 
  hadvnam, vadvnam, tendnam, fixcnam.  There are no matching outfld calls
  for these fields.  (The spectral cores do have outfld calls for these
  fields.) 

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/cam_diagnostics.F90
. if diag_cnst_conv_tend='none' or 'q_only' don't add the per constituent
  names for DCxxxx to the master field list

. add cnst_num_avail function to return the number of available slots in
  the constituent array.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/tracers_suite.F90
. modify to enable up to 999 copies of each of the 5 basic tracer types.
  That's a total of up to 5000 tracers.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/tracers.F90
. modify tracers_register to query the constituent module for the number of
  available slots in the constituent array, and to register test tracers in
  all available slots.  This assumes that the test tracers are registering
  last.

models/atm/cam/src/chemistry/trop_mozart/tracer_data.F90
. bug fix for cyclic mode.

One-line Summary: cam and surface components may now couple every cam time step

Purpose of changes: There is now the capability to have cam and the surface components
couple every cam time step. This capability can be invoked by simply setting the 
namelist variable, atm_cpl_dt in drv_in equal to the cam timestep (by default it is
set to 3600 seconds). The default behavior of the system is to still couple on the
cam shortwave radiation timestep. All tests have maintained this behavior.

One-line Summary: Vertical interp of prescribed constituents modified; PGI
 compiler workarounds; tuning mod; new dust optics.

Purpose of changes:

. Use hybrid coefficients and surface pressure if available to
  construct a pressure field to vertically interpolate the prescribed
  constituents.  Otherwise use the variable "lev" to vertically
  interpolate the prescribed constituents.  (fvitt)

. Mod to cam_diagnostics so that diagnostics needed by the AMWG package are
  always on the default history file.

. Mod to check_energy so that when printing of detailed column by column
  conservation errors is on (it's off by default), it's on for all
  processes and not just the masterproc.

. Tuning mod: reduce rhminh from .80 to .79

. Add default 30 level initial files for FV, 1.9x2.5, for running w/ UW
  PBL scheme.

. Change CLM to branch_tags/pftintdat06_clm3_5_05/.  This provides a fix
  for effective porosity having zero values, which apparently was not
  affecting the simulation, but was preventing us from running some tests
  in debug mode.

. PGI compiler (6.2-5) was failing to recognize aliases made in use statements.
  Workaround by using CAM's physconst module in place of share_const_mod. (jwolfe)

  Also modify code to avoid creating zero length substrings which are
  causing problems for the pgi compiler.

. Update the aerosol optics file.  The new file is backwards compatible
  with the previous one when using the old prescribed aerosol distributions
  (which is still the default).  It contains new optics for the prognostic
  dust (and the new prescribed dust) due to differences in how the size
  distribution is binned.

One-line Summary: CAM now couples to surface components only on shortwave timestep

Purpose of changes:

* The following changes force CAM to couple to the surface components on
  its shortwave radiation timestep only (currently this is hourly). This
  is the same coupling constraint that is currently used in ccsm
  mode. CAM now averages its output precipitation fluxes over the hour
  period and receives hourly averaged fluxes from the surface
  components. All states exchanged between CAM and the surface
  componenents are instantaneous. CAM also sends to all the surface
  components the calendar to use for the next zenith angle contribution
  to the albedo computation.

* The CAM-csim and CAM-dom/som components now have an hourly timestep
  and only calculate the albedos hourly. Previously, the CAM-csim and
  CAM-dom/som components updated the zenith angle every CAM timestep,
  which was incorrect, since CAM was updating its zenith angle only
  hourly (i.e. on the shortwave radiation computation).

* As a result of these changes, the CCSM CICE and DOCN7 componenents can
  now couple to CAM via the sequential driver (either on the CAM grid or
  on the displaced pole grid). CICE and DOCN7 will now be checked out
  with the CAM code and a new script in the bld directory,
  run-pc-cice-docn7.csh, accompanies this tag. This script permits CAM
  to couple to CICE/DOCN7 at T31 (thermodynamic ice mode only) or at
  T31_gx3v5.  Furthermore, the DOCN7 can be run either in prescribed SST
  mode or som mode. This script is a starting point for bringing the
  CCSM ice and ocn surface components into stand-alone CAM.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system:

* Changed the specification of coupling fields so that only one file is
  needed now, seq_flds_mod.F90. Optional coupling fields are now
  specified via the use of CPP directives in this file (i.e. GENSOM,
  DUST, PROGSSLT). This removes the needed for a different file and
  therefore a different filepath for every new coupling scenario. Changed
  configure to reflect this modification.

* Changed configure to permit the addition of CICE and DOCN7 as alternative
  ice and ocean components. The following new options can be provided to configure
     -ocn <name>        Build CAM with data SSTs or slab ocean model [dom | som | docn7]
     -ice <name>        Build CAM with sea ice model [csim4 | cice]

* If cice is selected for the -ice option then the following additional settings can be added
     -cice_nbx <n>      Number of cice blocks in x on 1 processor (default 4)
     -cice_nby <n>      Number of cice blocks in y on 1 processor (default 4)
     -cice_nlon <n>     Number of ocean/ice longitudes (only used for cice/docn7)
     -cice_nlat <n>     Number of ocean/ice latitudes  (only used for cice/docn7)
     -cice_ntasks <n>   Number of MPI tasks used to set cice block decomposition (default not set)

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

* The atm_cpl_dt is now set to 3600 by default in DefaultTIMEMGR_INPARM_Namelist.xml

* In additin, in SeqCCSM_namelist.pm, the coupling frequency of all
  components is now set to atm coupling frequency. In the future the ocn
  component (i.e. POP2) will be allowed to couple at a different
  frequency.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: None expected (not tested yet)

        - note that driver sync clock is advanced at the beginning of the time step now

M      models/ocn/dom/ocn_filenames.F90
       - removed previous interface and put in new interface for

       - time step is no longer advanced on restart

       - restart filename determined from sync clock time and no longer from rsfilename_spec_ice
M      models/ice/csim4/albice.F90
       - removed zenith angle calculation from code (now done independently in driver as is the case
         in cpl6
       - note again that ice zenith angle and albedo now updated only on the atm/surface model coupling interval,
         (i.e. cam sw radiation) and not every cam time step
M      models/ice/csim4/ice_comp_mct.F90
       - the merge to ocean now multiplies melth by aice (to be able to couple in cice) - so now divide melth by
         aice in the ice_import_mct routine since the merge to ocn will now multiply it back in
       - since driver sync clock is advanced at the beginning of the time step now, check of internal
         clock with sync clock is now made at the end of ice_run_mct        

M      models/atm/cam/src/control/atm_comp_mct.F90
       - removed all references to infobuf (shr_intputInfo will now be used for this information)
       - CAM now returns control to the driverafter it completes its shortwave radiation computation (i.e. hourly).
         However, since the sw computation is done one timestep into the hour (except for SLD), the CAM time
         will generally be shifted relative to the sync clock time step by one CAM timestep. As a result, 
         if iradsw is not 1, then an offset of -dtime is used to check consistency with sync clock at the 
         end of atm_run_mct routine.
       - CAM now averages precipation between coupling intervals and sends averaged precipitation back to the
         surface components (as is done in cpl6). 
       - CAM sends calendar day of next radation computation back to the surface components, and albedos will be
         computed for the surface components utilizing this calendar day.
       - restart filenames are now set by the sync clock date and not by the CAM internal date (see below)

M      models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_restart.F90

M      models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_history.F90
M      models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam/restart_physics.F90
       - for above five routines, now pass in 
         [yr_spec, mon_spec, day_spec, sec_spec] 
         as optional arguments to set the name of the restart file 
         (this will enable restart file name to trigger off of  the sync clock time 
         rather than the internal cam time, which for non-sld mode will be shifted by 
         a time step ahead of the sync clock time)
M      models/atm/cam/src/utils/time_manager.F90
       - removed dtime_in as argument (note that for cam_comp.F90, dtime_cam is no longer
         passed as an argument to eshr_timemgr_clockGet, but is now set to get_step_size()
         after the call to timemgr_init

       - the above testing changes needed to account for the fact that atm->surface
         component coupling only occurs on the cam shortwave radiation time
         step and that the GENSOM and DUST fields transferred no longer involve a 
         change to the filepath but rather require the specification of a CPP variable

One-line Summary: mod to trop_mozart boundary dataset reader

Purpose of changes:

. Modify the dataset reader in the trop_mozart tracer_data module so that the
  dataset does not need a time coordinate variable.  This reader is being used
  for oxidant datasets that use an integer date variable instead of a time
  coordinate. 

. update the use case "1870_prog_aero" to specify that the oxidant dataset
  should be treated as cyclic for year 1870.

. Changed the 1870 use cases for build-namelist to start simulations in
  year 0 rather than 1870, which is the convention for climatological runs.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Apply bug fix from Francis to the trop_mozart prescribed aerosol code
  (fix the molecular weights of the aerosol species).

Date: Tue Jun  5 09:26:59 MDT 2007
One-line Summary: updates to trop_mozart; add build-namelist use cases; misc bug fixes

Purpose of changes: 

. Updates to trop_mozart code to assume constituents use dry mass mixing
  ratios (fvitt).

. Fix the sea salt mass passed to the aerosol optics code by summing masses
  from the 4 sea salt bins into the 1 bin currently used by the optics
  (fvitt).

. Add new chemistry option which includes a simple GHG chemistry (CH4, N2O,
  CFC11, CFC12) in addition to the prescribed aerosols.  This is intended
  to replace the simple GHG chemistry that was enabled in CAM by setting
  the namelist variable trace_gas=.true..  This option is set by invoking
  configure with the arg "-chem trop_mozart_ghg_paero".  This option
  additionally allows reading the prescribed ozone from a 3D dataset which
  is spatially interpolated to the model grid.  (fvitt)

. Add ability to cycle the prescribed aerosol datasets.  This is needed for
  the 1870 and present day control runs. (fvitt)

. Add "-use_case" option to build-namelist to provide a single switch for
  setting up runs that require setting many namelist parameters.  Two use
  cases have been implemented:
  1870_prog_aero -- sets up run that was used to produce the 1870 aerosol
                    climatology 
  1870_control   -- sets up the 1870 control run which uses a simple GHG
                    chemistry, the 1870 prescribed aerosol climatology, an
                    1870 prescribed ozone climatology, and sets the solar
                    constant to 1366.5 W/m^2

. Update to mct/trunk_tags/MCT2_3_0_070524.  This fixes a memory leak.

. Update to timing/trunk_tags/timing_070525.  This fixes a problem with the
  timers that caused a seg fault on lightning (w/ pathscale) when a t_stopf
  call was made without a matching t_startf.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. defineqflux was broken on 64-bit platforms due to stdlib.h not being
  included (it's needed to provide the correct declaration of malloc).

. Fix compilation failure on IBM when compiling for pure OMP.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

. New namelist vars for trop_mozart chemistry
  character(len=16)  :: prescribed_ozone_name     ! prescribed ozone field name in netCDF
  character(len=256) :: prescribed_ozone_file     ! prescribed ozone file

  character(len=8)   :: tracer_srcs_type          ! 'CYCLICAL' | 'SERIAL' (default)

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. Defaults have been changed for emission datasets used by trop_mozart_aero
  to match the datasets used to produce the prescribed aerosol distributions
  to be used in future CCSM simulations.

  call from being made in initialization whose matching t_stopf call during
  the run phase then became unmatched).

. Include the stdlib.h header file -- needed for correct malloc declaration.

models/drv/seq_mct/seq_flux_mct.F90
. Move calls to mct_gGrid_exportRAttr so they are only called once rather
  than every step.  This avoids a memory leak discovered in the mct code.
  It's also a better to just make these calls once even without a memory
  leak.

Date: Wed May  2 16:02:20 MDT 2007
One-line Summary: 
    Addition of prescribed aerosols chemistry package with changes 
    to dust and trop_mozart external forcings.

Purpose of changes:  
    The new chemistry package and code changes are needed to be able to
    read the prescribed aerosol distributions that will be generated by
    runs with the prognostic aerosol package which was added at cam3_4_11.
    Note that both new aerosol packages are undergoing testing and 
    should not be used for scientific purposes.  CAM by default is still
    using the CAM-3.0 prescribed aerosol climatology.

    Update CLM to clm3_4_1.

    Update the CLM namelist defaults file.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 
   - vertical emissions altitude (external forcing) is now set to
     height relative to surface     
   - trop_mozart interactive dry deposition broadcast days of 
     climatological soil water data to all MPI tasks 

Describe any changes made to build system: 
   chemistry option added to configure script
	-chem trop_mozart_prescribed_aero

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:
    Update the CLM namelist defaults to use the correct PFT file, 
    the latest fsurdat file for FV 1.9x2.5, and a fully spun up IC file
    for FV 1.9x2.5.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: not yet tested...

One-line Summary: mods to deep convection, cloud fraction and aerosols;
                  update CLM and timing lib externals

Purpose of changes:

. Add dilute plume and convective momentum transport mods from Neale and
  Richter to ZM deep convection parameterization.

. Add a call to the cloud fraction routine after pcond (cloud microphysics)
  and move the outfld calls for the cloud fraction fields to be after this
  new call to cldfrc (Sungsu Park).

. Add the Vavrus "freeze dry" mod.

. Update to latest timing library tag (timing_070328).  This fixes the
  regression tests that were failing on tempest.

. Update to the latest CLM trunk tag (clm3_expa_98).

. The initial version of a new aerosol package is included, but should not
  be used for scientific purposes.  It will be updated shortly with mods
  required to produce an acceptable aerosol simulation.

. Add debug flags for pathscale to fix a problem with the regression tests
  on lightning (fix from Jim Edwards).

. Update the sample run scripts (from Mat Rothstein)

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 

 ID 409 - aqua-planet tests in cam3_4_04 fail on tempest
 ID 434 - fix fsnsoi gensom problem

Describe any changes made to build system:

. the new aerosol package is enabled by specifying "-chem trop_mozart_aero"
  to configure

Describe any changes made to the namelist: 

. some emissions datasets names have been added to build-namelist, but the
  datasets have not yet been moved to the standard locations.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the

bluevista: All PASS except:

014 bl151 TBL.sh e64h outfrq24h 2d ................................FAIL! rc= 7

056 bl711 TBL.sh h5x8dm adia 9s ...................................FAIL! rc= 7

. The Eulerian and FV baselines fail (bl151, bl375) due to a roundoff diff in
  a single diagnostic field (SWCF) introduced at cam3_4_07

. The HOMME baseline fails (bl711) due to answer changes introduced at cam3_4_10.

. The FV baseline that tests the gensom mode (bl331) fails due to the gensom
  bugfix.

tempest: All PASS except:

021 bl331 TBL.sh f4c11gdh pghgsul 9s ..............................FAIL! rc= 7

. bl331 fails for the same reason as on bluevista.

. Note that updating to the new timing lib fixed the problems with the
  aqua-planet tests.

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag: conv09_cam3_4_03 -- *** NOTE *** this tag was used for baseline
     comparisons to validate that the new physics was merged from the
     branch to the trunk correctly.  All baseline tests that exercise the
     standard physics will fail when this code is compared to cam3_4_10.

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations: All that use standard cam physics
- what platforms/compilers: All

  climate): new climate

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff? N.A.

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,

One-line Summary: SCM mode cleanup and additional namelist 
	functionality

Purpose of changes: replace scm specific netcdf routines with
	standard model calls and add surface forcing functionality
	to scm cam mode.  Also added hooks for relaxation to 
	obs and column radiation only modes to scm.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): na

Describe any changes made to build system: na

Describe any changes made to the namelist:  Added some new
	namelist variables for control of single column mode
	of scam.  New namelist variables are
	scm_iop_srf_prop = .TRUE. if using iop surface properties
	scm_relaxation   = .TRUE. if relaxing solution back to obs
	scm_diurnal_avg  = .TRUE. currently just a place holder for 
	                   diurnal averaging
        scm_crm_mode     = .TRUE. run scm in column radiation mode

CAM tag used for the baseline comparison tests if different than previous
tag: cam3_4_06

Summarize any changes to answers, i.e.,
- what code configurations:
- what platforms/compilers:
- nature of change (roundoff; larger than roundoff but same climate; new
  climate): bit-for-bit on all platforms.  One roundoff diagnostic on bluevista
	which subsequently passed when run with debug turned on.

If bitwise differences were observed, how did you show they were no worse
than roundoff?  Turn on debug and they went away.  Also the difference in
	absolute values was in the least significant bit of one number in
	the domain.

If this tag changes climate describe the run(s) done to evaluate the new
climate in enough detail that it(they) could be reproduced, i.e.,

One-line Summary: refactor configure script

Purpose of changes:

. Refactor the configure script by moving the generic functionality of
  managing a configuration file into a new module (Build::Config), and
  leave the CAM specific parts in the configure script.  A detailed design
  with instructions for how to modify and extend configure is being
  prepared as part of a new CAM Developer's Guide.

  configure's commandline interface contains the following changes:

  .  -nlat, -nlon, -trk, -trm, -trn have been removed as well as removing the
     "custom" option to -res.  A new resolution is added by putting the
     appropriate entry in the config_horiz_grid.xml file.

  .  The -res argument is being replaced by the option -hgrid to specify the
     horizontal grid.  The -res argument will be supported for backwards
     compatibility.

  .  -nnadv has been removed since the feature of "non-advected
     constituents" was removed at cam3_3_47.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system: 

. new configure script.
. build-namelist updated to use new Build::Config module to read the
  config_cache.xml file (which has a new structure).

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. [ID 405] The code currently crashes when writing the restart pointer
  files for the dom, som, and csim components unless the user has
  explicitly set these names via the namelist.  This has be fixed by
  providing appropriate default values.

One-line Summary: cam dom/som now called after cam run phase

Purpose of changes:
Summary: Moved the ocean component to now be run after atmospheric component to 
	 permit incorporation of an active ocean component that is only called 
	 once per day. Made the driver code and specification of surface fields 
	 exchanged between components part of SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system:

Describe any changes made to the namelist:
- Introduced separate hard-wired namelist files for cam (atm_in),
  cam-dom/som (ocn_in), cam-csim (ice_in) and the sequential driver (drv_in). 
	
- The new cam-csim namelist is as follows:
  namelist /csim_inparm/ prognostic_icesnow, reset_csim_iceprops, &
  ice_conschk_frq, icecyc, rest_pfile, nrevsn
	
- The new cam-dom namelist is as follows:
  namelist /dom_inparm/ sstcyc, nrevsn, rest_pfile
	
- The new cam-som namelist is as follows:	
  namelist /som_inparm/ sstcyc, som_conschk_frq, rest_pfile, nrevsn
	
- The new driver namelist file contains the namelists 	
  ccsm_inparm and timemgr_inparm (which were previous in single namelist file "namelist") 

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by: mvertens, mvr

List all subroutines eliminated:
D      models/drv
- directory removed and made external
D      models/atm/cam/bld/atmlndnl.pm
	
List all subroutines added and what they do:
A  +   models/ocn/dom/ocn_filenames.F90
A  +   models/ocn/dom/ocn_time_manager.F90
A  +   models/ocn/som/ocn_filenames.F90
A  +   models/ocn/som/ocn_time_manager.F90
A  +   models/ice/csim4/ice_filenames.F90
A  +   models/ice/csim4/ice_time_manager.F90
- Made cam-dom, cam-som and cam-csim no longer dependent on the cam time 
  manager. Now each of these components has a separate time manager module 
  that is initialized from the sync clock the same way as the cam time manager 
  is initialized from the sync clock.  Also made cam-dom, cam-som and cam-csim 
  have a cam-independent specification for their restart file names. These 
  routines (ocn_filenames.F90 and ice_filenames.F90 now utilize the component 
  specific time manager routines rather than the cam time manager).
	
A  +   models/ocn/som/ocn_constants.F90
- Added new module to specify tfrez and cpw independent of the cam-csim code. 
  This removed an implicit dependency between the cam-som and cam-csim code.

One-line Summary: fixes for file archiving & eshr time manager; test suite enhancements

Purpose of changes:

. Fix problems observed in recent NCAR production runs involving failed
  transfers to MSS and failed restarts on automatic resubmissions.  Part of
  the problem appears to be due to the LSF batch system killing msrcp
  processes when the CAM processes are finished.  The LoadLeveler batch
  system did not do this.  The fix implemented was designed to restore the
  same behavior we had under LoadLeveler by issuing the msrcp commands that
  occur on the final timestep syncronously, i.e., don't let CAM finish
  until the requested file transfers are successful.

  Note that having CAM be responsible for file archiving is undesirable for
  several reasons, chief among them being that the implementation is not
  portable.  We intend to implement a file archiving script for CAM similar
  to the file harvester used by CCSM.  But the current ability of CAM to
  archive files at NCAR will be maintained until a better solution is in
  place.

. Fix logic for determining the last timestep in share code for ESMF
  time manager.  This eliminates the need to use the optional arg nextstep
  to get the correct behavior.

. Enhancements to test suite (from mvr) include:

  - Allow user to specify a project number on SCD machines via the
    CAM_ACCOUNT environment variable.

  - Print summary of the cprnc output to the log file, including a list of
    fields that contain differences.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Fix problem in boundarydata.F90 (from jedwards) that was causing seg
  fault trying to interpolate unstructured grid cyclic dataset between
  December and January.

. update csm_share externals to point to csm_share/branch_tags/scmshr_tags/scmshr02

models/csm_share/eshr/eshr_timemgr_mod.F90
. fix logic in eshr_timeMgr_clockisOnLastStep
. change eshr_timemgr_clockAlarmIsOnRes to call

. add method eshr_timemgr_curTimeLEstopTime which returns true when the 
  current time is <= the stop time.

models/atm/cam/src/control/atm_comp_mct.F90
. remove nextstep=.true. arg from call to eshr_timeMgr_clockIsOnLastStep
  that sets nlend.

models/atm/cam/src/control/con_cam.F90
. remove unused reference to eshr_timemgr_clockIsOnLastStep

models/drv/seq_mct_drv/seq_ccsm_drv.F90
. use new method eshr_timeMgr_curTimeLEstopTime in timestep loop
. remove nextstep=.true. from call to eshr_timeMgr_clockisOnLastStep which
  sets the logical for removing files
. modify the last msrcp call, which is for the driver restart file, to be
  synchronous. 

models/atm/cam/src/control/ioFileMod.F90
. modify putfil so that at the end of run when the files are not to be
  removed after archiving, the archiving commands are issued
  synchronously.  This is to avoid having the batch queue kill the
  processes that are trying to archive files.

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam1/boundarydata.F90
. fix allocate statement that was causing seg fault trying to interpolate
  unstructured grid cyclic dataset between december and january.

models/atm/cam/bld/DefaultTIMEMGR_INPARM_Namelist.xml
. add default start_ymd for HOMME ne5np8 resolution initial file.

models/atm/cam/bld/DefaultCTL_NL_Namelist.xml
. change statefreq to 60 from 1 (per J Edwards).

models/atm/cam/test/system/TBL.sh
. Remove grepping for non-zero comparisons in cprnc output -- this belongs
  in the CAM_compare.sh script

models/atm/cam/test/system/CAM_compare.sh
. Enhance to print summary of cprnc output to the log file, including a
  list of fields that contain differences.

models/atm/cam/test/system/test_driver.sh
. Allow user to specify project number on IBMs via CAM_ACCOUNT environment
  variable.
. Modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include pgi libs even when using lf95 for
  testing on CGD clusters.  This is because cprnc was built with pgi.

  This failure is expected since I fixed the start_ymd to be consistent with

One-line Summary: Merge of GEOS5 and CAM fv-dycores

Purpose of changes:

	o  Added mass fluxes to the output of the FV dycore (Putman)

	o  Added cubic vertical interpolation (Takacs) to used optionally
	   (flag te_method=1) in the remapping.

	o  More FV constants were cleaned up in a consistent way (Bug #214)
           in particular, pi=4*atan(1.0) was replaced by F90 parameter with
	   sufficient significant digits (cause non-zero differences!)

	o  Refactoring to remove many CPP #if defined(GEOS_MODE) distinctions

Originator(s): eaton

One-line Summary: Remove non-advected constituents option; misc bug fixes & enhancements.

Purpose of changes:

. Remove the "non-advected" constituents option.  This option allowed
  constituent transport by the physics parameterizations, but disabled
  large-scale advective transports.  It was used by the original prognostic
  cloud water scheme, but is no longer needed.

. Add configurations for 1/4 and 1/2 degree FV grids.  Add
  dycore/resolution specific parameters in cldwat and cloud_fraction
  modules. 

. Fix interpolation code diagnostic that caused cam to quit if all columns
  in a process fell into an "extrapolation region" of the input dataset.
  The test only makes sense when interpolating on the global grid; not on
  sub-domains.

. Fix bug in driver that was preventing the CAM banner from being printed.

. Modify build-namelist defaults for FV, 1.9x2.5.  The default landfrac is
  now consistent with the coupled model resolution 1.9x2.5_gx1v4.

. Modify build-namelist to fail with informative message if user specifies
  ncdata but not start_ymd.  This is because build-namelist has default
  values for start_ymd which correspond to the default datasets used for
  ncdata.  If the user overrides the default ncdata, then the default
  start_ymd should also be overridden since the default may be inconsistent
  with the dataset specified for ncdata.

. add fix to XML::Lite parser code to recognize attributes when there is
  optional white space between the equals sign and the value.  Also allow
  the attribute values to be enclosed in single quotes as well as double
  quotes.

. modify build for a homme run

. Add some initializers for index values in FV (from Art Mirin).

. replace deprecated float() intrinsic with real().

. fix for spaces in the name of the spmdstats file (from Pat Worley).

. update mct external to trunk tag MCT2_3_0_070112

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Bugzilla bug 89:
  Change to cd_core.F90 required to enable the ifort compiler to compile the
  omp directive surrounding "do 4500" loop.

. Bugzilla bug 65:
  Remove a informative print statement from inside an CSD region (caused
  problem on Cray-X1E).

. add fix for intermittent problem Tony found running in coupled mode on
  bassi (NERSC IBM p5).  Add initializer for srfflx_state2d%qref.

. fix ctl_nl.pm (a homme namelist) so that it doesn't ignore the resolution
  found in the config_cache.xml file.  Remove the hardcoded value of "ne"
  from Default_CTL_NL_Namelist.xml.

. NOTE -- initial commit and tag contained problem with svn external
  definitions.  Deleted that tag, fixed definitions, recommitted and
  retagged.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: 

. Add checks to build-namelist to fail if ncdata is specified without
  specifying start_ymd.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

. New CLM datasets for FV, 1.9x2.5.  These datasets are consistent with the
  landfraction used for CCSM runs (1.9x2.5_gx1v4).

The failure of the FV, 1.9x2.5 baseline comparisons are expected due to a
change in the default landfrac file for that case.

The failure of the CCSM restart test is still under investigation.  The
latest CCSM tag in collections (ccsm3_1_beta42) is also failing with
cam3_3_46 which means the failure is not associated with the mods in this
commit.

bluevista:
Some code was moved from timestepping routines to initialization
routines. In cldwat.F90, this causes a roundoff change
on bluevista that causes the following baseline tests to fail:

tempest:
The roundoff difference as seen on bluevista seems to
show up in a waccm test that fails:	
017 bl314 TBL.sh wg10dh outfrq3s 9

The baseline model field DTCOND included the effects of the energy 
fixer (which is actually a fix to the nonconservation of the
dynamics). We moved the call to diag_conv_tend_ini from its position
above the energy fixer to below it, which makes the field different
and allows the heat budget to work out. This causes the following tests to
fail (only DTCOND is different):
021 bl331 TBL.sh f4c11gdh pghgsul 9
024 bl332 TBL.sh f4sdh ghgrmp 9 
031 bl352 TBL.sh f2o outfrq24h -2

One-line Summary: Added single column mode to CAM

Purpose of changes:  

	This commit adds a single column mode (SCM) to CAM.  The scam 
	GUI is being refactored and has been removed from the 
	trunk.  The CAM single column mode is controlled via the 
	standard cam namelist.  Additional namelist parameters allow
	cam to be forced using a standard IOP dataset. Future commits 
	will add back much of the original scam and column radiation 
	capablity as well as an updated GUI. 

	To run cam in single column mode you need to invoke the standard
	cam configure script with the -scam option and compile the model
	as usual. Although single column mode only runs with the eularian 
	dynamics most other options for configuring cam (resolution, external
	libraries, etc) will work.  Next invoking the build-namelist
	script will provide a namelist template for running with the
	default ARM IOP.  The build-namelist procedure requires the user
	to supply namelist values for the latitude and longitude of the
	IOP column using the namelist variables scmlat and scmlon.
	In practice though the user must also specify the starting date
	and timesteps to run as well as an appropriate initial condition.  
	The following parameters to the build-namelist script may be used for
	running with the various IOP datasets.  The initial data being read
	in and used as a background for each of the IOPs is the standard
	SEP 1 initial condition.  It is suggested that the user generate an
	initial condition closer to the starting date of the IOP.
        Once the namelist is generated the user may run cam and analyze the
	standard history tape produced for the IOP column with any netcdf
	visualization tool.

	The relavent namelist parameters for use with the single column mode
	of cam are:
	
	single_column = .true.
	scmlat = xxx  ! scm latitude to use for the model run
	scmlon = xxx  ! scm longitude to use for the model run
	iopfile = 'xxx' ! iop boundary condition file

	In addition to the standard IOP datasets the single column version
	of CAM may be forced with an intial condition file and a "pseudo
	IOP" history file generated from a previous global CAM run. This
	mode is useful for getting a feel for how new physics modules
	behave given forcing from an actual CAM run.  To generate an
	initial condition and IOP style forcing data from a standard cam
	run configure the model using the new -camiop option of the
	configure script.  The build-namelist script has been modified to
	generate a namelist which will create an initial condition for a
	scm model run as well as an auxillary history tape containing the
	IOP fields needed to drive a single column version of CAM.  Both
	the initial conditions file and the IOP forcing history tape are 3
	dimensional.  When running with these datasets in SCM mode the
	user can choose which column will be used via the namelist
	parameters scmlat and scmlon.

	The relavent namelist parameters for generating an CAMIOP are

	 fincl2 = 'Ps','u','v','t','q','omega','phis','Prec','lhflx','shflx',\
           'Tsair','Tg','divq3d','divT3d','dcldice','dcldliq','beta',\

	 nhtfrq         = 0,1
	
	
Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

Describe any changes made to build system: Added -scam and -camiop options
	to configure script.  The -scam option will configure cam for
	single column mode.  The -camiop option will configure cam to produce
	an iop initial condition file and a  boundary forcing history tape
	to be used in single column mode.
	
Describe any changes made to the namelist:  Added namelist parameters for
	single column mode.  Since all surface models need single column 
	control information the following namelist variables were added 
	to ccsm_inparm

	! enable single_column mode
	logical	 ::   single_column   ! default false set to true to
	                              ! enable single column mode

	! single column longitude 
	real(r8) ::   scmlon          ! longitude setting used by cam in
	                              ! scm mode
	! single column latitude 
	real(r8) ::   scmlat          ! latitude setting used by cam in
	                              ! scm mode

	The following namelist variable was added to the cam_inparm namelist

	! iop boundary file
	integer, parameter :: max_chars = 128
	character(len=max_chars) iopfile      !IOP Boundary condition file


	Added the CAMIOP option to the inithist namelist variable.  This
	option will produce an initial condition for use with a cam
	generated iop forcing history tape.

	! inithist   Generate initial dataset as auxillary history file
	!            can be set to '6-HOURLY', 'DAILY', 'MONTHLY', 
	!            'YEARLY', 'CAMIOP',  or 'NONE'. 
	!                      default: 'YEARLY'

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:
The majority of the modifications had to do with removing the 
#define SCAM sections of code.  There is still some duplication of
functionality that will be cleaned up in future commits (reading of
netcdf data).  The pieces of independent single column mode code
are delineated now by a run time 'if (single_column)' test.  The single_column
logical is defined in the ccsm_inparm namelist and is available to all component
models.  Files in the test and bld subdirectories were modified to allow
bit for bit testing of scam against a control run of the 3d model as well
as adding functionality to the build-namelist and configure scripts to make
running in single column mode easier.

Tag name: cam3_3_42
Originator(s): Patrick Worley
Date: 24 Nov 2006
One-line Summary: refactored timer instrumentation and support for single timing output file

Purpose of changes:

	To update timing instrumentation to reflect recent model changes,
	and to improve 'coverage' by adding timers for all top level events.

	To improve usability on large numbers of processes by decreasing number 
	of process count-dependent files and lines of output:
	  - added option to generate single timing and spmdstats files
	    (containing all of the information that had been spread between
	     multiple files before)
	  - added option to restrict reporting of many runtime options and 
	    memory usage statistics to process 0
	These new options are enabled by default

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):
        'debugging' shr_sys_flush call in seq_domain_mct.F90 erroneously left in 
	during earlier check-in caused error on Cray X1E

Describe any changes made to build system:
	Added new CPP flags:
	- MULTIPLE_PERF_FILES: if defined, timing and output files will be
	  created for each process (the previous default)
	- WRAP_MPI_TIMING: if defined, timing events are defined for each MPI
	  call in wrap_mpi.F90 (the previous default)

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets:

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:

Code reviewed by: Patrick Worley

List all subroutines eliminated:

List all subroutines added and what they do:
	t_pr_onef in utils/timing/f_wrappers.c:
	  variant of t_prf that write all timing data in one file
	t_enablef in utils/timing/f_wrappers.c,
	GPTL_enable in utils/timing/gptl.c:
	  runtime timing routine enabler
	t_disablef in utils/timing/f_wrappers.c,
	GPTL_disable in utils/timing/gptl.c:
	  runtime timing routine disabler

One-line Summary: Added functionality and flexibility to the trop_mozart chemistry.

Purpose of changes:  

	To implement flexibility in the chemical mechanism used in trop_mozart 
	chemistry package.  This flexibility is provided
	via:
	 - flexible namelist variables
	 - helper functions which use data provided by the chemical preprocessor

	Use cam implemented prognostic sea salt and dust with the trop_mozart
	chemistry package.

	Use cam implemented rain out of trop_mozart aerosols.

	Provide the ability to use cam sulfur chemistry routines with trop_mozart
	chemistry package.

	Provide the ability to use prescribed chemical constituents and sources
	in trop_mozart chemistry package.

	Fix bug in the offline driver on bluevista.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 
	#239 fv offline driver fails in cam on bluevista

	-- this gives the trop_mozart chemistry the opportunity to use 
	the "cam" sulfur chemistry routines without the wet deposition.
	
    atm/cam/src/physics/cam1/sulfur_intr.F90
	moved some of the addfld calls to sulchem.F90 -- where the

One-line Summary: Misc updates

Purpose of changes:

. Replace all occurances of 273.16 either by SHR_CONST_TKFRZ or by tmelt
  which is the CAM specific constant that's set to SHR_CONST_TKFRZ in the
  physconst module.

. Remove the cfort.h file -- put the Fortran name mangling CPP macro into 
  CAM and SCAM's configure.

. Remove cfort.h from the timing library.  This required creating a new
  trunk_tag for the timing library (timing_061028) and updating CAM's
  external property to use it.

. Update MCT to trunk_tag MCT2_2_3_061018.

. Update CLM to trunk_tag clm3_expa_76.

. Remove excessive info/debug print statements (there is more to do).

. Fix bug (introduced at cam3_3_34) to enable running w/ HOMME dycore.

One-line Summary: Top level driver now invokes cam as one run phase
	
Purpose of changes: To have CAM called as one run phase from the top level driver.
This is necessary if the surface components are to couple to cam at frequencies
other than the cam time step (a feature that will be required for a sequential CCSM).

       - Seq_ccsm_drv.F90 and scam_run.F90 will now call only one run phase of cam. 
         The basic idea is that the first time the cam run phase is called outside 
         of the time loop, it will only call tphysbc. Within the run loop the cam 
         mct levelrun phase will call tphysac, update the cam time and then call tphysbc.

a ccsm single-executable; bluevista replaces bluesky as required pretag 
test platform; mods to conform to changes in ccsm's test scripts

Purpose of changes: one more naming conflict in ccsm single-executable 
that was overlooked; bluesky is scheduled for decommission by the end 
of the year, so bluevista will now be the platform required for testing 
cam prior to commits; ccsm changed its default behavior for cleanup 
of files after successful tests - a change was made to specifically 
turn off this cleanup and let cam's test scripts handle the cleanup

One-line Summary: use cpl6 ocn/atm flux calculation and surface flux sign convention

Purpose of changes: To bring the current sequential system in line with the 
  concurrent system atm/ocn flux calculation, ocn and ice and merge functionalities,
  and ccsm surface flux sign convention. In addition, to remove the need for the ice
  and ocean components to know pass any landfrac information to the top level driver.

      Some of the above fields are not currently used - but are place holders for

   M  atm/cam/tools/scam/scm_init/init_model.F90
      - Added domain information to mapping initialization

   M  drv/seq_mct_drv/seq_ccsm_drv.F90
      - Added domain information to mapping initialization

   M  drv/seq_mct/mrg_x2a_mct.F90
      - Replaced index_o2x_Faoo_lwup with index_xao_Faox_lwup 

   M  drv/seq_mct/mrg_x2o_mct.F90
      - Merging functionality for input to ocn component is now same as cpl6

   M  drv/seq_mct/seq_domain_mct.F90
      - maxfrac_o = 1.- maxfrac_l is set for points where maxfrac_l > 0 and
        maxfrac_l < 1. The same is true for maxfrac_i. As a result, the ocean 
        and ice components need not know the land fraction in the gridcell.
        Furthermore, the ice fraction need only be scaled as that relative to
        the total gridcell for merging functionality from drv->atm. The ice fraction
        is only needed relative to the ocean part of the gridcell for merging 
        functionality from drv->ocn.

   M  drv/seq_mct/seq_flux_mct.F90
      - xao_o%rAttr(index_xao_Faox_lwup,n) is now used (instead of lwup
        being calculated by the ocean components)
      - flux_albo is not identical to cpl6 code

   M  drv/seq_mct/flux_ao.F90
      - This code is now the same as the flux_atmOcn routine in the cpl6 flux_mod.F90.
        Both this routine and flux_atmOcn will be migrated to a csm_share/shr/shr_flux_mod.F90
        code base in upcoming tags.

   M  drv/seq_mct/seq_mct_mod.F90
      - Added use aliases for mct_aVectimport Rattr and mct_aVect_exportRattr

   M  drv/seq_mct/map_atmice_mct.F90
      - Obtain maxfrac_ice on atmosphere decomp, needed for merging to atmosphere grid
        when all components are on same grid and when partial land cover in ice gridcell.
      - Added domain information to initialization phase 

   M  drv/seq_mct/map_atmlnd_mct.F90
   M  drv/seq_mct/map_iceocn_mct.F90
   M  drv/seq_mct/map_atmocn_mct.F90
      - Added domain information to initialization phases 

   SVN_EXTERNALS has been updated to clm3_expa_75
   M  lnd/clm2/src/main/clm_time_manager.F90
      - Removed write statement to fort.30
   M  lnd/clm2/src/main/lnd_comp_mct.F90
      - Changed sign convention of fluxes sent to driver to be consistent 
        with those used by concurrent ccsm

Purpose of changes: to create the minimal code base that generates the
  greater than round-off changes in cam3_3_37. Since cam3_3_37 will
  contain number round-off level changes for som, it is useful to isolate
  the few pieces of code that produced the greater than round-off differences.a

Code reviewed by: mvertens
   M models/ocn/dom/ocn_comp.F90
     - Computation of lwup is occuring before temperature is updated. This is
       now consistent with obtaining lwup from atm/ocn flux computation. This
       will ensure that all fluxes in atm/ocn flux computation (including lwup)
       are based on the same surface temperature.
   M models/ocn/som/ocn_comp.F90
     - No longer multiplying onf by 1.-aice. Now doing this to each component of
       onf in ocn_comp_mct.F90
   M models/ocn/som/ocn_comp_mct.F90
     - Now multiplying Foxx_melth, Foxx_swnet, Foxx_sen, Foxx_lat and Foxx_lwdn, 
       and lwup by 1.-aice.
   M models/atm/cam/src/control/atm_comp_mct.F90
     - At first time step determine the longwave up flux from the surface
       temperature. This is identical to what is being done in ccsm_msg.F90
   M models/drv/seq_mct/seq_flux_mct.F90
     - Put in computation to no longer require lat/lon to be passed in radians
       from the ocean domain. Ocean domain will now pass lat/lon in degrees and 
       will convert to radians.
     - Set ocean albedos to 1. when coszen < 0.
   M models/drv/seq_mct/flux_ao.F90
     - Set umin to 0.5_r8 
       This is the only answer changing modification between this code and the 
       atm/ocn flux calcuation code in cpl6. The goal is for both the concurrent 
       and sequential ccsm to use the same atm/ocn flux calculation code base.
       Note that the diagnostic TREF will be totally different when the cpl6 
       atm/ocn flux calculation is utilized

List all subroutines added and what they do:
These are data modules which replace the common blocks eliminated above, 
because the fv_control_mod contains namelist variables it needs to be compiled
regardless of dycore - thus it's location in the control directory.

One-line Summary: Reduce init time (#213), clean up FV constants (#214), allocate status (#166)

Purpose of changes:

	o  PILGRIM initialization time has been reduced (Bug #213).  This has 
	   been achieved by removing the communications for XZY index and replacing
	   them by XYZ communication patterns.  These are assembled by generating
	   an XY decomposition comm. pattern, then extending it to 3D in the 
	   (undistributed) Z direction.  This reduces initialization time, drastically
	   in the case of high resolution.  Note that this change required extensive
	   restructuring of cam_history.

	o  The status of allocation of large 3-D arrays in FV is checked (Bug #166)

	o  FV constants were cleaned up in a consistent way (Bug #214), e.g.,
	
  	     real(r8), parameter ::  D0_0                    =  0.0_r8
	     real(r8), parameter ::  D0_5                    =  0.5_r8
	     real(r8), parameter ::  D1_0                    =  1.0_r8
	     real(r8), parameter ::  D1_5                    =  1.5_r8
	
Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):  #166, #213, #214

Describe any changes made to build system:  none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:  none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:  FV initialization time is
	now much faster, especially so for high resolutions.

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

	models/atm/cam/src/control/cam_history.F90:  Extensive changes to use 
	    XYZ indexing to gather and scatter arrays.  Now only one type of 
	    PILGRIM gather/scatter operation (fv_gather_??, fv_scatter_??)
	    is used.  Addition of routines to copy the *local* portion of the 
	    array from XYZ -> XZY (loc_xyz_to_xzy) and XZY -> XYZ (loc_xzy_to_xyz)
	    decompositions.  Performing this local give a minor performance 
	    improvement.  Overall this reduces the length and complexity of the
	    module. Treats the writing of the staggered U-winds field (which 
	    has 1 less latitude than other fields) in a cleaner way.  Now
	    writes all fields to restart consistently in XYZ indexing.

One-line Summary: Enable linking to external ESMF library

Purpose of changes:

. Changes to configure and Makefile.in to allow linking to ESMF library
  This can be done by:
  1. setting the new -esmf_libdir option,
  or
  2. by setting the environment variable ESMF_LIBDIR.

  Either of these methods will cause configure to check that the
  files libesmf.a or libesmf.so and esmf.mk are present in the specified
  directory.  The esmf.mk file is produced when the ESMF library is built
  and contains Makefile macros that CAM's Makefile will reference when
  compiling and linking to the external library.

. Remove interactive mode from configure.

. Cleanup of Makefile.in.  Remove untested SUN and OSF1 sections.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

. Fix bug in fv/inidat.F90 applying perturbation to initial temperature
  field.

. Fixed SCAM build on bangkok.

Describe any changes made to build system:

. Add ability to link to an external ESMF library.  The default remains to use
  the WRF_ESMF time manager code.

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: none

List all subroutines added and what they do: none

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

models/atm/cam/bld/configure
. Add capability to specify that an external ESMF library should be used.
. Add test for linking to the ESMF library to test suite invoked by
  configure's -test option.
. Add ability to try running a successfully built test.  This helps to
  identify problems related shared libraries not being found.
. Remove interactive mode.
. Simplify verbose mode; now set by "-v" option without a numeric argument.

models/atm/cam/bld/Makefile.in
. Include the esmf.mk file if ESMF_LIBDIR is defined.
. use ESMF_F90COMPILEPATHS from esmf.mk to set search path for esmf module file .
. Use ESMF_F90LINKPATHS and ESMF_F90ESMFLINKLIBS from esmf.mk to set search
  path and library name for linking to external esmf lib.
. Remove 32-bit addressing option for AIX.  If this is needed somewhere it
  should be re-implemented in configure rather than by requiring editing of the
  Makefile.
. Remove unused SUN and OSF1 sections.
. Substantial cleanup.  Tried to eliminate duplicated code from the
  architecture specific sections of the Makefile.  Tried to organize the
  architecture specific sections to more or less follow the same order of
  setting macros.

models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/inidat.F90
. fix bug in how perturbation was applied to initial temperature field.

models/atm/cam/test/system/test_driver.sh
. increase to bluevista time limit from 2:28 to 4:28 to account for
  slowdown in compilation times
. update pathscale compiler version to 2.4 from 2.2.1 (on lightning)

models/atm/cam/tools/scam/ui/configure
. add -lpgc to the LINK_LIBS macro in the Linux section.

If there were any failures reported from running test_driver.sh on any test
platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,
then copy the lines from the td.*.status files for the failed tests to the
appropriate machine below.  All failed tests must be justified.

One-line Summary: moved atm/ocn flux calculation to top level

Purpose of changes:

Moved the atmosphere/ocean flux calculation out of the ocn (dom/som)
models and up to the top level driver. This is a necessary stop in constructing
a sequential ccsm system. It will also enable the use of the cpl6 atm/ocn flux
calculation to be utilized in both the sequential and concurrent system.

    Summary: New attribute vectors xao_o and xao_a were introduced at the top level 
             to account for the calculation of the atm/ocn flux calculation. 

             The routines dom/srfoce.F90, dom/flxoce.F90 and som/flxoce.F90 were replaced with 
             drv/seq_mct/flux_ao.F90 and drv/seq_mct/seq_flux_mct.F90.
             The current form of flx_ao.F90 is such that it can be replaced with
             the equivalent coupler code once sign conventions are addressed. (Note,
             to increase clarity som/ocn_srf.F90 and som/mixed_layer_globalcalcs.F90 were
             merged to create som/mixed_layer.F90).

             The ocean albedo calculation was also moved out of the ocean code and 
             put into seq_flux_mct.F90. As a result, ocn/som/albocean.F90 and
             ocn/dom/albedo.h are no longer needed). The new routine to calculate ocean albedos, 
             seq_flux_albo_mct, is now contained in seq_flux_mct.F90.

	     Ocean input information was significantly altered as a result of bringing the atm/ocn
             flux calculation out of the ocean code base. The CAM DOM code now does not need any 
             input information. The CAM SOM code also requires significantly less input information
	     (only netsw from the atmosphere). 

             It is important to note that lwup is still being computed in the ocean code. The 
             impact on SOM needs to be evaluated when moving this calculation to the 
             atm/ocean flux routine (as is done in the cpl6 code).
             
             The routine, wtrc_flxoce.F90 (isotope calculation) was moved out of the ocean model 
             and into atm/cam/src/control. The extra fields necessary to do this 
             computation (ustar, re, ssq) were added to the x2a attribute vector.
             Note that this feature is currently not tested.

platform, and checkin with these failures has been OK'd by the gatekeeper,

One-line Summary: Changes necessary for moving atm/ocn flux calc to top level

ocean code and into the top level application driver. 

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): None

Describe any changes made to the namelist: None

Code reviewed by: eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: None

List all subroutines added and what they do: None

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

    M  ocn/dom/ocn_comp.F90
	- Moved update of ocean temperature to after calculation of ocean surface/fluxes
          This was done to be consistent with SOM update and to be able to move the atm/ocean
          surface flux calculation to the top level driver without introducint cpp ifdefs. 
          This change also required writing the surface temperature to the ocean restart file.
          This modification will result in greater than round-off level differences with cam3_3_25.
        - removed the call to sstan and made the conversion from degees K to C explicit
        
    M  ice/csim4/ice_types.F90
    M  ice/csim4/ice_comp.F90
    M  ice/csim4/ice_diagnostics.F
        - Removed "precsc, precsl, precc, precl" as ice_in types and replaced them with "snow"
          since only snow is needed as input to csim. This change should only result in round-off
          level differences with cam3_3_25.
    M  ice/csim4/ice_comp_mct.F90
	- In addition to only using "snow" as input from the application driver, also removed 
          x2i_i%rAttr(index_x2i_So_tsocn,g) as input and instead used  
          x2i_i%rAttr(index_x2i_So_t,g)-SHR_CONST_TKFRZ. This change should only result in
          round-off level differences with cam3_3_25.       

    M  drv/seq_flds/dust/seq_flds_mod.F90
    M  drv/seq_flds/default/seq_flds_mod.F90
    M  drv/seq_flds/gensom/seq_flds_mod.F90
    M  drv/seq_mct/mrg_x2i_mct.F90
    M  drv/seq_flds_indices/seq_flds_indices.F90
         - replaced  'Faxa_rainc', Faxa_rainl','Faxa_snowc','Faxa_snowl' as input to ice
           with 'Faxa_rain' and :Faxa_snow'        

    M  drv/seq_mct/mrg_x2a_mct.F90
         - Removed calculation of ts for non-fractional grid box 
           This makes the merge consistent with that done in cpl6.

One-line Summary: mods to eliminate naming conflicts in the ccsm 
single executable; increased max fields for history tapes; 
minor test driver enhancements

Purpose of changes: the move to a single executable for running 
cam as part of ccsm introduced some naming conflicts that needed 
to be resolved; running cam in ccsm and turning on the chemistry 
and co2 blew out the maximum allowed fields on a history tape

One-line Summary: fix some intent attributes in various high level interfaces

Purpose of changes:

. Some of the intents for derived types that contain pointer components are
  wrong in the FV interface routines.  In this situation the intent refers to
  the association status of the pointer, not to the target of the pointer.
  Fix these intents in fv/stepon.F90 and fv/dyn_comp.F90.

. cam_run1 has args cam_in and cam_out declared intent(inout).  Most of the
  components of these user defined types are arrays of length pcols, but
  we're adding components that are pointers, and probably all the
  components should be pointers.  Since for pointer components the
  intent(inout) doesn't make sense, and for non-pointer components it's the
  default, this intent has been removed.  Also switched the order of these
  args to match the convention of listing input args first.

. replace the variables surface_state2d and srfflx_state2d by cam_out and
  cam_in respectively in physpkg.  There are alot of other places where
  this still needs to happen.

. utils/timing/f_wrappers.c was missing the header file string.h.

  . remove the intent(out) attributes of dummy args dyn_in and dyn_out in
    both stepon_init and stepon_run1.  That intent
    implies that the pointer components should be associated in this
    routine.  But the pointers were previously associated in
    dyn_create_interface and the targets are what is being set here.

One-line Summary: Update icesst tools; add column burden diags; FV fixes/cleanup.

Purpose of changes:

. Update the icesst tool to recognize the new datasets being provided by
  Dennis Shea.  These have a CF-conforming time coordinate and the date
  information in YYYYMMDD format is moved to a new date variable.
  Also needed to change some fixed sizes in bcgen/solver.f90 to allow for
  the new datasets starting from 1870 rather than 1949.
 
. Add hist_fld_active query function to history.F90.  Returns whether or
  not a field is active on any history file.  This enables the ability to
  not perform expensive diagnostic calculations if they aren't being asked
  for in the history output.  (Contributed by Keith Lindsay.)
 
. Add column burden diagnostics for all constituents except water vapor.
  These are not put on the history tapes by default.  The names of the
  output variables are of the form 'TM'//cnst_name.  Not enabled for SCAM.
  (Contributed by Keith Lindsay.)

. Add modcomm_gatscat to namelist (bugfix); fix defaults for some modcomm
  options; cleanup of comments.  (Contributed by Art Mirin.)

	The dynamics fields that were previously added to the history output from
	the history_defaults file have been moved to dyn_init so that each dycore
	is responsible for declaring the fields for which outfld calls will be made
	using the dynamics decomposition.

	Moving addfld calls into dyn_init created a circular dependency, i.e.,

	 dyn_comp -> history -> io_dist -> dyn_comp

	io_dist uses dyn_state (in dyn_comp) to access the decomposition info
	needed for gathers.  We broke the chain by putting dyn_state in a separate
	module, i.e.,

	 dyn_comp -> history -> io_dist -> dyn_internal_state

	Another side effect of moving addfld calls into dyn_init was to require
	moving the setting of the dyngrid_set variable (and give it the more
	appropriate name dyndecomp_set) to a place in front of these calls.  It was
	previously being set in initcom which is after the dyn_init call.  It
	should be set as soon as the parameters that determine the dynamics
	decomposition are known.  It can probably still be set earlier than it is
	currently.

	The gather/scatter methods in phys_grid have been modified to work when the
	global field is on either a lat/lon grid or an unstructured grid.
	(Contributed by Pat Worley.)

	The wrapper routines in wrap_nf have been moved into a module.  This
	provides interface checking for these routines.

	More work has been done to the dycore interface for HOMME in the
	dynamics/homme directory.  This work is still in progress.

One-line Summary: Fix and improve prognostic aerosol packages

Purpose of changes: Some of the existing prognostic aerosol packages
did not function out-of-the-box. Furthermore, the dust package was
outdated, the sea salt was actually diagnostic and the carbon 
offered only one simple scenerio.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): none

Describe any changes made to build system:
Added configure option for prognostic aerosol packages
	-prog_aero sulfur,caer4,caer16,dust,seasalt
Invoke with comma-separated list of any combination of the above.
This adds the correct number of advected constituents to the build and
defines cpp tokens required for dust, seasalt and the new 16-constituent
carbon aerosol package. 
	
Describe any changes made to the namelist:
The configure option for prognostic aerosols is used by build-namelist to
	set namelist variables related to the aerosol packages.
Added namelist variables to control implementation & feedback of dust & sea salt.
   aero_progsslt         
		Set to .TRUE. to turn on prognostic seal salt aerosols
                should be set by build-namelist, as needs cppdefs too
   aero_feedback_progsslt
		Set to .TRUE. to enable feedback of prognostic sea salt
		aerosols. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
   aero_dust          
		Set to .TRUE. to turn on dust prognostic aerosols
                should be set by build-namelist, as needs cppdefs too
   aero_feedback_dust
	        Set to .TRUE. to enable feedback of dust
                prognostic aerosols.

To avoid confusion with the existing co_emis_file namelist variable, 
	renamed emissions file for prognostic carbon aerosol:
OLD co_emis 
NEW caer_emis
	
List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none
	
Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none
When run without aerosols, there are no changes.

Originator(s): Erik Kluzek
Date:  Thu Jul 13 21:17:44 MDT 2006
One-line Summary:

Purpose of changes: Put in top level initialization and clock objects at driver level
  for moving forward with sequential CCSM.

  This separates out the driver from the internals of the CAM time-manager. Making 
  the top level driver separable from CAM itself, and moves it toward a Sequential 
  CCSM where the sub-components can be swapped for other CCSM components (such 
  as the CCSM data models or active ice and active ocean models).

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): 153

  Fix bug in test_driver.sh where if BL_ROOT was NOT set -- it would erase the
  entire contents of your /ptmp/$USER directory after it was finished.

Describe any changes made to build system: Add csm_share/eshr directory to Filepath

Describe any changes made to the namelist: Split into 4 namelists.

  ccsm_inparm ----- Sequential CCSM driver level initialization information
		    (passed to all subcomponent models: atm, lnd, ice, ocn)
  timemgr_inparm -- Sequential CCSM driver level clock information
		    (passed to all subcomponent models: atm, lnd, ice, ocn)
  cam_inparm ------ CAM specific namelist
  clm_inparm ------ CLM specific namelist

The ccsm_inparm namelist is managed by the shr_inputInfo_mod.F90 module and objects.
The timemgr_inparm namelist is managed by the eshr_timemgr_mod.F90 module and objects.
These are both sequential CCSM top level driver objects that are passed into
sub-components (atmosphere, land, sea-ice, and ocean) to manage information that is
shared between sub-components.

CHANGE SO THAT THE NAMELIST IS NO LONGER READ FROM STDIN -- THE NAMELIST NAME IS
ASSUMED AND THE FILE OPENED EXPLICITLY. When namelists read the file is opened, and 
namelists are read until the correct one is found, then the file is closed. If the
needed namelist does not exist -- OR THERE IS AN ERROR IN IT -- the program will abort
with an error.

The interface to build-namelist still uses the input namelists of: camexp and clmexp
and will divide the relevant namelist items to the appropriate namelists.

Option added to build-namelist: -ignore_ic_date

by default build-namelist will match the start date/time (start_ymd,start_tod) for
initial condition datasets. If a suitable dataset with the correct starting date
(as well as resolution and other matching criteria) isn't found -- an initial condition
dataset will NOT be provided.

If you use the -ignore_ic_date option is used datasets will be matched without 
examining the starting date/time of the dataset.

Namelist items removed:

  restart_nsteps --> use restart_option and restart_n
  restart_nhours --> use restart_option and restart_n
  restart_ndays ---> use restart_option and restart_n
  restart_monthly -> use restart_option and restart_n
  restart_yearly --> use restart_option and restart_n
  no_restart ------> use restart_option and restart_n
  nelapse ---------> use stop_option and stop_n
  nestep ----------> Functionality removed
  nsrest ----------> Use start_type

Example creation of the old and new namelist using build-namelist:

With cam3_3_14: 

  build-namelist -runtype initial -namelist "&camexp nelapse=-1, restart_monthly=.true., iyear_AD=1990/ "

with cam3_3_15:

  build-namelist -runtype startup -namelist "&camexp stop_option='ndays', stop_n=1, restart_option='monthly' , orb_iyear_AD=1990 /"

So build-namelist figures out that all of the above options belong in the timemgr_inparm namelist
and deal with it appropriately.  And results in the following namelist:

&ccsm_inparm
 case_name              = 'camrun'
 start_type             = "startup"
/
&timemgr_inparm
 atm_cpl_dt             = 1200
 orb_iyear_ad           = 1950
 restart_option         = 'monthly'
 start_ymd              = 901
 stop_n         = 1
 stop_option            = 'ndays'

How to override information on the restart file from the namelist: **

  By default for a continue or branch type of simulation -- driver information is
  read from the restart file and namelist information is ignored. In order to explicitly
  use driver level restart information you have to do the following:

  1.) Set given namelist item(s) you want to override.
  2.) Set restart_file_override (or restart_file_TGRoverride for timemgr_inparm namelist)
      to include the colon delimited list of items you want to override on the namelist.
  3.) To override the case_name -- set the brnch_retain_casename namelist item to true.

  List of ccsm_inparm items that can be overridden: mss_irt, mss_wpass, and case_desc
     (and case_name is brnch_retain_casename is set to true)
  List of timemgr_inparm items that can be overridden: restart_option, restart_n

  Examples

  build-namelist -runtype continue -namelist \
  "&camexp mss_irt=45, mss_wpass='example', restart_file_override='mss_irt:mss_wpass' /"

  The above example will override the values of mss_irt, mss_wpass from the restart file
  with those given on the namelist. Note if restart_file_override were missing, the
  values on the restart file would be used an the values on the namelist ignored.

  build-namelist -runtype continue -namelist \
  "&camexp restart_option='nyears', restart_n=2, restart_file_TGRoverride='restart_option:restart_n' /"

  The above example will override the values of restart_option, and restart_n from 
  the restart file with those given on the namelist. Note if restart_file_override 
  were missing, the values on the restart file would be used an the values on the 
  namelist ignored.

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: make sure IC file names are
  consistent with dates in file.
  Also add ic_ymd and ic_tod to describe the date (YYYYMMDD format) and time-of-day (sec)
  that the given initial condition file represents.

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: none

bluesky: All tests pass except the CCSM comparison test

  055 cs998 TCS.ccsm.sh ERS f19_g13 K ...............................FAIL! rc= 2

  CCSM failed because the new CCSM scripts for this tag don't work with the old CAM
  Thus the comparison to the old CCSM tag and cam3_3_14 had to be done by hand.
  The comparison is exact if esmf_wrf_timemgr is updated in cam3_3_14 to
  esmf_wrf_timemgr_051212. If not the difference is bit-for-bit until the 25th time-step
  when the difference is off by roundoff. This was documented in the cam3_3_4 commit
  where we had a roundoff difference due to the new esmf_wrf_timemgr.

  For running CCSM test use:

  env CAM_CCSMROOT=/fs/cgd/csm/models/atm/newchg_ccsm3_1_beta34

One-line Summary: created new generate som mode for mct coupling

Purpose of changes: Remove output of ice/ocn specific fields from
   mrg_x2a_mct.F90 and move then to atm_comp_mct.F90. All routines
   in mct_drv/ should be devoid of cam specific information.

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID): None

Describe any changes made to build system: default seq_flds_mod.F90
   to be used is currently in drv/seq_flds/gensom. This corresponds
   to extra fields being sent to the atm which would only be used
   for SOM input fields generation. Changes need to be made to
   the testing scripts and configure to support a gensom option.

Describe any changes made to the namelist: None

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: None

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes: The extra
  fields being sent to atm_comp_mct.F90 might have a very small
  performance penalty. However, a fix for this is expected in the
  very near future.

      * domains were implemented using the MCT general grid data structures
      * the current general grid components that I am defining are
        lon,lat,area,mask and maxfrac (maxfrac is the maximum fraction
        that the model can have on any gridcell - for the landthis
        corresponds to the landfrac, for the ocn and ice this should
        correspond to 1.-landfrac when everyone is on the same grid)
      * domain checking is only done on the master processor at
        initialization (via an MCT gather on the general grid)
      * essentially, domains enable grid and fraction checking to be done
        at the top level by the master processor and eliminates the use
        statements contained in the land model. The consistency check for
        fractional land is somewhat different than in the current flux
        coupler. Basically, when all the models are on the same grid, you
        want the "maximum fraction" from each component to be consistent.
        What this boils down to is that the max_frac from the ocn/ice must
        equal (1.-landfrac)to within some eps (I have specified 1.e-13).      
        In the ccsm cpl6 system, the ocn determines the landfrac,and on the
        ocean grid maxfrac is either 1 or 0. This is clearly different
        than in the current system.

Purpose of changes:

  . Fix problem with CAM log file not being written during CCSM run.  The
    fix was provide by tcraig in bugzilla bug 102.

  . Set MPI_TYPE_MAX environment variable for testing on tempest
    (sgi-o3800).  This problem started in cam3_3_3 with FV code updates.
    It is only a problem on machines that have a default value which is too
    small.  Currently setting MPI_TYPE_MAX=100000 is sufficient.  The
    problem has also been observed on phoenix (cray-x1e).

One-line Summary: FV dycore improvements, fix omega diagnostic

Purpose of changes:
   o  The XY decomposition is now the only one which is
      visible to the outside user (YZ is hidden).  This 
      simplifies the CAM-specific part of FV (code inside 
      the dynamics/fv directory but outside of the portable
      FV core) enormously.
     
   o  A dynamical core interface has
      been written which is ESMF-like (init, run, final)
      using an import and export container, and implementing
      a dynamics state.
 
   o  Correct calculation of OMEGA, and related diagnostics.
 
   o  Resynchronized versions of FV dycores and PILGRIM
      between GEOS5 and CAM (except GEOS5 vertical remapping).  
 
   o  Numerous other software engineering improvements 
      (all bit-for-bit).

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:
  M  src/control/con_cam.F90
	Modifications put in so that only the lead/master MPI process
	redirects its stdout to the appropriate component model log file when
	running fully coupled, instead of having every process "open" the same
	log file.  This change solves the problem of logs getting trashed on
	phoenix (which has been recently experienced).  The only down side is
	that warning and error messages generated by other processes
	(non-master processes) get stuck in the job's stdout file, so users
	may want to archive job output files as well as component model logs.
	In addition, when debugging problems with the model system, certain
	error messages which may have previously appeared in component model
	logs may now appear in the job output.

   M src/dynamics/fv/trac2d.F90
   M src/dynamics/fv/cd_core.F90
        Removed streaming directives for COUP_CSM mode where a routine is called
        from within a streaming region. This problem does not exist in stand-alone
        CAM mode, but causes the system to hang or crash in coupled mode. This is   
        bug will be reported to Cray, but a fix has currently been implemented so
        that production runs can occur on phoenix.
        the following changes was made for cpp directives:
        #if defined(USE_OPM => #if (!definedUSE_OMP) && (!defined COUP_CSM)

Code reviewed by: myself, eaton

List all subroutines eliminated: none

List all subroutines added and what they do: none

List all existing files that have been modified, and describe the changes:

  a) Vectorized routines chunk_to_buff and buff_to_chunk used by MCT in
     land/atmosphere communication and in coupler/atmosphere communication:
  
  M atm/cam/src/physics/cam1/phys_grid
   - buff_to_chunk, chunk_to_buff: interface clean up and vector-friendly 
  reimplementation
  
  M atm/cam/src/control/ccsm_msg.F90
  M atm/cam/src/control/MCT_atm_comp
   - changed parameters in calls to buff_to_chunk and chunk_to_buff
  
  b) Fixed bug on X1E caused by diagnostic message output inside streamed 
     code segment
  
  M atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv/fill_module.F90
   - surrounded (non fatal) error test with ifdef DEBUG cpp logic
  
  c) Introduced workaround for PGI compiler bug
  
  M lnd/clm2/src/biogeophys/Hydrology2Mod.F90
   - removed unnecessary "use" of spmdMod
  
  d) Optimized performance of MCT Rearranger routine
  
  M utils/mct/mct/m_Rearranger
   - added new optional parameter ALLTOALL and modified code in rearrange_
     to implement an MPI_Alltoallv option for interprocessor communication.
   - reordered the send/receive pattern for the non-ALLTOALL implementation
     to decrease link and processor contention.
   - Reduced number of allocate/deallocate requests.
  
  M utils/mct/mpi-serial/collective.c
  M utils/mct/mpi-serial/mpi.h
   - add mpi_alltoallv interfaces (from Ray Loy)

  M lnd/clm2/src/main/MCT_atmlnd_cpl
   - added optional parameters VECTOR and ALLTOALL to calls to MCT_Rearrange,
     setting VECTOR to .true. if CPP_VECTOR is defined, and setting
     ALLTOALL to .true. if SYSUNICOS is defined. Otherwise they are
     set to .false. .
  
     Note that ALLTOALL=.true. may be a better choice for all systems,
     but I have only verified this on the X1E.
  
  e) Improved vector performance in CLM/MCT interface.
  
  M lnd/clm2/src/main/MCT_lnd_comp
   - made minor change to index logic to improve vectorization on the X1E
  
  f) Improved performance (both vector and nonvector) in routines that 
     map to/from CLM grid
  
  M areaMod
   - added support for mapping multiple fields in one call to 
     gridmap_mapparray
   - reimplemented gridmap_mapparray to improve vector performance, 
     incuding changing calling interface
  
  M clm_atmlnd
   - modified logic in clm_mapa2l and clm_mall2a to call gridmap_array once
     for all fields
   - made other minor modifications to improve vectorization

One-line Summary: configure and Makefile mods

Purpose of changes:

  . Modify Makefile to enable threading with lf95 and pathf90.
    *** N.B. *** lf95 (v6.2) still has severe per thread stacksize limits.
    I was only able to get threading to work with the --threadheap option
    which puts the thread memory on the heap.  That option however doesn't
    work with debug flags -g, --chk, or --chkglobal.  Set up the Makefile
    to allow threading only in non-debug mode.

  . Modify configure so that the checks for include files and libraries are
    not done when the -ccsm flag is set since the CAM Makefile is not used
    in that case.

  . Modify configure to require that the configure script and all
    associated configuration files live in a specified subdirectory of the
    source tree for the source being built.  This is for robustness.  Using
    configure with source or configuration files from outside a source tree
    that represents a fixed source version is fraught with peril.

  . Add -linker option to the configure script to enable specifying a
    linker which is different from the Fortran compiler.  This is
    particulary useful on Linux platforms where specifying mpif90 as the
    linker automatically provides the correct linkage for the MPI
    libraries.  Note that this depends on the user's PATH being set so that
    the correct mpif90 is used, i.e., the one that's consistent with the
    Fortran compiler being used.

  . Modify configure to run its tests in a subdirectory of the CAM build
    directory.  This avoids having the Makefile build the dependency list
    for the full CAM just to run the tests, and consequently they run much
    faster.

  bld/configure
  . Remove -cam_cfg option and CAM_CFGDIR environment variable: require all
    configuration files to be in the same directory as the configure script.
  . remove -cam_root option and CAM_ROOT environment variable: require
    configure to be located in the CAM src tree.
  . Modifications for CCSM build: delete setting of locations for all
    external include/mod/lib directories.  These are only needed for the CAM
    Makefile which is not produced when doing a CCSM build.  
  . Remove -esmf_* options.  This was used with the ESMF prototype library
    which is no longer supported.  Will re-implement ESMF options when we
    start linking the new ESMF library.
  . add -linker option
  . use it to set the USER_LINKER macro in the Makefile
  . Run tests in a subdirectory of the CAM build directory.

  bld/Makefile.in
  . add "--openmp --threadheap 4096" to FFLAGS and LDFLAGS when SMP is
    defined for lf95 compiler
  . add -mp to FFLAGS and LDFLAGS when SMP is defined for pathf90 compiler
  . Remove default settings of macros that are set by configure.
  . Remove ESMF macros except for ESMF_MOD and ESMF_LIB.  Currently these are
    not set by configure, but they will be when we start linking to the ESMF
    library. 
  . add LINKER macro to be used to link cam executable.
  . set LINKER to $(USER_LINKER) if it's defined, otherwise use platform
    default which is $(FC) on most platforms, but is "$(CC) -f90lib" on the
    SX6 and ES.

  bld/mkDepends
  . add fix from Tom Henderson to include Fortran syntax includes in the
    dependencies (previously only recognized cpp syntax).

One-line Summary:

  Update to the tropospheric chemistry code and fixes to the offline driver.

Purpose of changes:

  The updates to the tropospheric chemistry code where done to include 
  into CAM the latest MOZART chemistry and to provide the option to 
  to use interactive dry deposition and interactive photolysis rates
  rather than the prescribed table look up methods.

  Changes to the offline dynamics driver were done to fix a total energy 
  conservation issue that was evident with simulations longer than two 
  months.  A fix to a bug which occurred in high resolution runs is also
  included.

One-line Summary: 

  Workaround for xlf90 (v9.1.0.3) bug (on bluevista) & test script updates.

Purpose of changes:

  The workaround for the compiler bug allows running on bluevista.  Note
  that there is still an unresolved bug on the platform affecting the
  trop_mozart chemistry mode.

  The TBR.sh test script has been modified to work around a GPFS
  problem (sometimes files that have just been copied don't appear in the
  output from an "ls" command executed in the directory that the files were
  just copied to) which causes the branch test to fail intermittently on bluesky.

  Misc changes in the overnight test scripts.

One-line Summary: refactor restart logic and fix restart bug

Purpose of changes:

  Provide control of when restart files are written that is decoupled from
  the behavior of CAM's history file writes.  

  Also did some cleanup work:
    . get rid of anncyc, nlhst, itsst
    . move nlres and lbrnch into restart module  -- get it out of comctl.h
    . call set_restart_filepath from restart_setopts -- remove from runtime_opts
    . move the restart filepaths into the restart module -- get them out of filepaths.F90

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

  At cam3_2_24 the restart writes for fields needed by CAM's ocean and sea
  ice modules were moved into the run methods for those modules.  This broke
  the writing of restart files in all situations except at the end of the
  model run when the restart triggers off the nlend flag.

  The problem is that the calls to write the restart files for the ocean and
  ice models are made before atm_run4 which makes the calls to write CAM's
  history file.  Since the old logic to determine when it's time to write a
  restart file depended on the state in CAM's history module, and that state
  was being updated after the calls to write the ocean and ice restart files,
  the ocn and ice restarts were out of sync with CAM's restarts except when
  nlend=.true.  The fix was to implement a separate logic for writing restart
  files that doesn't depend on the state of CAM's history module.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist:

  The namelist variables nrefrq and itsst have been eliminated.

  New namelist variables added:
     logical :: no_restart      ! true => turn off all restart writes (default: false)
     integer :: restart_nsteps  ! restart interval in steps
     integer :: restart_nhours  ! restart interval in hours
     integer :: restart_ndays   ! restart interval in days
     logical :: restart_monthly ! true => write restart at begining of each month (default: true)
     logical :: restart_yearly  ! true => write restart at begining of each year

One-line Summary: Bug fixes for memory leak and misc.

Purpose of changes:  bug fixes

Bugs fixed (include bugzilla ID):

1. Fix memory leak introduced in cam3_0_20.  Briefly the problem is that the
   overloaded .not. operator defined in diffusion_solver.F90 returns an object
   of type vdiff_selector for which memory is allocated, but this operator is
   used as an actual argument in the call to compute_vdiff in
   vertical_diffusion.F90, and so the memory is never assigned to a variable
   which can be deallocated.

2. The T field in initial files for FV when 2D decomp is used are bad.
   This was caused by a problem with an array index in
   fv/diag_dynvar_ic.F90

3. The history restart files were being removed at the end of the run.  The
   normal CAM behavior is to not remove any files written at the end of the
   run. 

4. The filepath for tgcm data was being truncated at 80 characters.

Describe any changes made to build system: none

Describe any changes made to the namelist: none

List any changes to the defaults for the boundary datasets: none

Describe any substantial timing or memory changes:
 Memory leak fixed.  The severity of this problem depends on what the
 compiler did with an object returned by a function that was being used as
 an actual argument.  The problem was most severe with the lf95 compiler.

Changes to CLM land-model: One - fixed bug with scam specific code.
	
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes

Changes made:

This is basically a bug fix for SCAM as well as adding some
small changes to get rid of autopromotion dependency in SCAM.
Changes are bit for bit for CAM/CCSM.  I did update the datasets
used by SCM to by consistent with the latest datasets for CAM
so the CRM test output also needed to be updated to reflect this.

A list of files changed follows:
	
history_defaults.F90 - added cpp def BFB_CAM_SCAM_IOP around cam/scam 
	               bfb specific code
runtime_opts.F90 - scam initializes with the name of the topo and initial 
	           conditions datasets
startup_initialconds.F90 - made changes to include this file in scam 
	                   intial calls
inidat.F90 - changed scam specific code to use topo info off of topo dataset
.scam_defaults - updated to use topo file and newer boundary dataset files
scam/configure - Brian's changes to get rid of autopromotion
scam/testscript - added tests to check consistency of .scam_defaults 
	          datasets with CAM namelist.
                  added tests for scam to run in default mode.
getnetcdfdata.F90 - Brian's changes to get rid of autopromotion
init_model.F90 - add topo dataset to scam
inital.F90 - call cam routine setup_initial from scam specific code.
ipc.h - added topo dataset to scam
runtype.h - added topo dataset to scam
scamMod.F90 - let scam initialize topo and initial conditions dataset names
scam_fifo.c - pass topo dataset to scam initialization
scam_run.F90 - fix bug with scam - don't run lsm if no land present
setlatlon.F90 - fix bug with scam - don't error out in iop run if iop 
	        dataset has different column latitude and longitude than 
	        initial data.
IOPSelectDateDlgImpl.cpp - cleanup
OptionsDlg.ui - add topo dataset to scam dataset tab in gui
OptionsDlgImpl.cpp - add topo dataset to scam dataset tab in gui
crm.cpp - add topo dataset to scam
dataset.cpp - add topo dataset to scam
fifomodel.cpp - add topo dataset to scam
manager.cpp - add topo dataset to scam
rpcmodel.cpp - add topo dataset to scam
crmtest26.out - crm radiation values changed slightly when we changed 
	        the default datasets to match the current cam defaults
clm_camMod.F90 - fix bug with scam - don't run lsm if no land present also 
	         get rid of spurious SCAM returns in this file

Changes made:
All reference to macros __FILE__ and __LINE__ have been removed.  
File ozone_data.F90 was cleaned up to remove variables which are no longer used.
A further pergrow test was conducted with chemistry enabled since some of the changes in the previous commit involved chemistry but the pergrow test did not.  This is why the test were rerun against 3_2_38 instead of 3_2_39.

Besides we wanted to close the CVS repository with a nice even number. :-)

6+3 tests are expected to fail due to problems in the testing procedure introduced in cam3_2_37.
TBL tests failed due to order of operation changes.  A perturbation growth test was conducted and passed to show these are errors are order round-off.
The scamtest does not work for me in the test script, the scamtest was sucessfully run by hand.

Changes made:
Added file physics/cam1/zonalbndrydata.F90
moved netcdf interface in chemistry.F90 and ozone_data.F90 to this new file.
In the past the chemistry file read a full years data at the initial time and held it in memory while the ozone file read two months data and updated during the run when it needed new data.  The new file supports both methods but requires that you choose one or the other at compile time.  The second method is now the default.  

Several minor changes were made in other files, mostly removing unused references to plat and plon.  The interface was changed for one chemistry routine which required changes in all flavors of the chemistry files and dynamics inidat files. Below is a complete list of changed files:

Reworked recently introduced interpolation changes to contain the method within a physics chunk and eliminate dependence on the phys_grid module.

Fixed a bug in phys_gmean in which the number of fields passed in was hardcoded, and the incoming number of fields argument was ignored. 

Removed unused 'use ' statements in waccm_mozart.

Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

Remove: models/utils/esmf:
  Remove all prototype ESMF files. 

Add: models/utils/esmf_wrf_timemgr:
  Put in WRF implementation of ESMF_2_1_0 time-manager API.

Changes to build:
  Change build so default is to build with WRF ESMF time-manager. Can also use 
  externally compiled ESMF_2_1_0.
  
  Linking with external ESMF: non-default, have to build ESMF externally
   and send appropriate command-line options to configure to use this option.

  Get rid of ESMF_ROOT as unneeded now. Now have three
  tokens for dealing with ESMF: ESMF_BLD, ESMF_LIB, and ESMF_MOD.
  Setting any of those threes means to link with external ESMF.
  If ESMF_BLD is set, the Makefile will figure out the path
  based on uname and debug option to the default version of ESMF.
  If ESMF_LIB and ESMF_MOD are set the full paths will be used
  for these two. The external version of ESMF that you link to is
  assumed to be a current download of ESMF, which has it's own build
  system. The current ESMF does not have a build for several important
  platforms: Cray, Pathscale, ES, NEC etc, therefore only the esmf_wrf_timemgr
  version can be used there. Also there were bugs with linking that will
  need to be worked out on our standard platforms, before this will work
  reliably

  Change configure so SPMD information isn't duplicated in configure output 
  files.

Changes to time_manager:

  Update time_manager.F90 so uses the ESMF_2_1_0 API instead of the prototype
  ESMF API. Create unit-tests in models/atm/cam/tests/unit/control to do
  extensive testing of the time-manager interface. Runs different time-intervals  and different ways of setting the stop-date, with one simulation period from
  year 0 to year 9999. Answers were compared to the previous time-manager and
  found to be bit-for-bit on IBM, SGI and Linux-PGI compilers.

  Calendar can not be set to GREGORIAN right now, only NOLEAP is allowed.
  esmf_wrf_timemgr could be extended to allow both calendars, or we can start
  using ESMF externally to handle both calendars.

Changes made:
	
No cam physics code was modified. Only clm interface code was modified.
Modified models/lnd/clm2/src/main/clm_camMod.F90 (only several lines of clm code 
were commented out) so that cam and clm grid do not have to be bfb. The 
tolerance is that the grid latitudes/longitudes grids match to 1.e-12. 
The fractional land however, must be identical. The clm code base has 
now been updated to clm3_expa_45.

Two 10 year integration for the entire set of physics changes using climatological SSTs
were performed. See:

Added the ability to specify the file that contains the LANDFRAC field.
The namelist variable bnd_landfrac is used to specify the path of this
file.  If not specified the default is to use the file that the topography
fields are read from.

Moved the physics initialization routines into phys_init.  Removed
subroutine inti.  Also add initialization of grid information to the
physics_state objects that are allocated in phys_init.  This information is
needed to be passed to the physics init routines that do spatial
interpolation of boundary data.

Misc:
. Fix for problem with WACCM_MOZART on SGI: was failing to write abs/ems
  restart file.  Resolves bugzilla #19.
. Bugfix in lf95 section of Makefile (reference to apex_subs.F changed to
  apex_subs.F90).

Changes made:
Synchronizing FV with NASA version introduced code that does run
efficiently on the Cray vector system (and probably not on the Earth Simulator
either). These changes bring performance back to what it was before, as well
as vectorizing buffer copies in the communication layer.

dynamics/fv/cd_core.F90, dynamics/fv/sw_core.F90
  eliminated unnecessary array segment specifications in subroutine calls where it
  was causing array copying 
dynamics/fv/mapz_module.F90
  restructured recently added code to improve vectorization
dynamics/fv/trac2d.F90
  replaced pointer-based implementation of double buffering algorithm with an 
  equivalent index-based implementation, working around a problem on the Cray X1E
utils/pilgrim/mod_comm.F90, utils/pilgrim/parutilitiesmodule.F90
  restructured buffer copy loops for improved vectorization; general clean-up and optimization

Some of the timer logic was also broken in a recent check-in:
control/cam.F90, control/cam_comp.F90
  fixed timer logic
utils/timing/gptl.c
  fixed problems in mpi_wtime support in timing routines

Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

High level structure changes:

Make multiple run methods in cam_comp and stepon to reduce duplication and move
the time-loop up to the top level driver seq_ccsm -- still called cam.F90.
Remove nlend from comctl and make local data, passing down to relevant subroutines
and functions that need it.  Make Gaussian weights and etamid module data
in cam_comp. Move all initialization calls for ocean or ice into one initialization
call (calls to read_restart_xxx moves to inside relevant initialize subroutine). And
move write_restart_xxx calls for ice and ocn inside of ice and ocean run method. Create
final methods for all component models (ice, ocn, land, atm). Use ncol in derived types
rather than using get_ncols_p method. Move tssub from surface_state derived type to private
data inside of camice. Move allocation of input/output derived types from driver to inside
of relevant component (ice, ocean, or land). Remove the temporary place-holder
restart_camsrf.F90 surface restart file. Remove ice_frac in camice and start using areafrac
and move merge of fractions to camhub_comp. This takes care of CCSM/ESMF Stage 1-2.6, 1.4
and 1.7, and some work on 1.9.1. This creates drivers and component modules that have the
bulk of the Pre-ESMF work complete.

See the "CCSM/ESMF Stage-1 Release Schedule" at...

       http://swiki.ucar.edu/start/66

SCAM Changes:

Get SCAM and testscript to run on Darwin. Make Eulerian data dimensioned plat/2 to (plat+1)/2,
so will compile correctly with SCAM. Add "skip" and "noclean" as command-line arguments to
SCAM testscript to skip the CAM build/run and/or don't clean before the build of CAM or SCAM.
These are both useful for using testscript interactively for debugging running SCAM. Add
ability to testscript to run CAM at different resolutions and operate over any point
given (it gets the latitude and longitude needed for SCAM from the IOP file produced).

CAM Makefile change:

Get rid of auto-promotion on Darwin compile (Mac-OS-X with Absoft IBM XLF/XLC compilers).

Changes to CLM land-model: Yes - Explicitly typed variables and constants
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

Nearly every file in CAM standalone was modified, some extensively, but most
changes were "syntactic". Note that this includes most Fortran source in csm_share, ice,
lnd, and utils as well as in atm. Only the tool subdirectories were "spared".

The steps were as follows:

a) in atm/cam/src, the routines

chemistry/waccm_mozart/apex_subs.F
chemistry/waccm_mozart/svdcmp.F
chemistry/waccm_mozart/wei96.F
physics/waccm/msise00.F
utils/fft99.F
utils/sgexx.F

   were all changed from fixed format that used implicit typing
   to free free format with "implicit none"
   and explicitly typing of all variables. (The suffixes
   were all changed from .F to .F90 as well.)

b) Tom Henderson's tool "addrealkind" was used to
   change "real" declarations to "real(r8) and to add
   "_r8" to all floating point constants that weren't already typed.
   "use shr_kind_mod" was added where needed.
   (For csm_share/shr. SHR_KIND_R8 was used instead of r8.
    In csm_share/cpl, R8 was used. In ice/csim4, dbl_kind was used.)

  (For Tom's tool to work correctly, the name of the module was appended
   to "end module" in a number of files, and "end" was replaced
   by "end subroutine xxx" or "end function yyy" in a number of
   files as well.)

   complex declarations were also changed to complex(r8)

c) float(iii) and real(iii) were replaced by real(iii,r8).
   cmplx(xxx,yyy) was replaced by cmplx(xxx,yyy,r8).
   dble(iii) was replaced by real(iii,r16) if r16 was really necessary,
   otherwise it was replaced by real(iii,r8).
   Constants of the form xxx.yyyDeee were replaced by xxx.yyyEeee_r16
   if r16 was necessary, otherwise were replaced by xxx.yyy.Eeee_r8.

d) specific intrinsics were changed to generic intrinsics,
   e.g. alog10 was changed to log10, etc.

e) removed local definitions of r8 and r16 when they were identical to
   those in shr_kind_mod, but left the local definitions as is if they
   were different.

f) compiler flags that defined real variables to be double precision (or real*8)
   and/or promoted floating point constants and intrinsics to double precision
   were removed from the CAM makefile. (Something similar will need to
   be done in CCSM.)

Finally, a new command was added to phys_grid to indicated whether phys_grid
had been called or not. This logical function was used in camhub_comp.F90
in place of the existing error-prone tests for this condition.

Changes to CLM land-model: Interface with cam_comp changes
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

Move the cam3_2_21_brnchT_chghilev_8 tag onto cam_dev.

Add changes to esmf, cam, scam, and cprnc to build/run on Darwin (Mac-OS-X) platform
with the ABSOFT IBM XLF/XLC compilers. On Darwin scam will compile, but not link
at this point. More work needs to be done for it to completely build and run.

Create a cam_comp component module to encapsulate the atmosphere part
of CAM. Make stepon into a module with initial, run and final methods.
Have scam interface with cam_comp rather than underlying subroutines.
Have scam interface with runtime_options in a more straightforward manner,
that won't require duplication of default settings for SCAM inside scam
initialization. Rename scam_inital to inital module a module for scam replacing
the Eulerian inital.

The next step is to make cam_comp have multiple run phases, and stepon have
multiple run phases (this is outlined in each stepon). Then bring the time-loop
out of stepon and up to the driver level. The driver is still called cam.F90, but
will soon be refered to as sequential CCSM to distinquish it from cam_comp the
atmosphere only component, of the stand-alone CAM modeling system.

This is documented as Stage-1.2-6 on the CCSM/ESMF webpages....

Changes made:

Consolidate code into spmd_utils.F90 that sets up the generic spmd
environment.  In particular, move pmgrid variables masterproc and iam,
spmd_dyn variables npes, nsmps, proc_smp_map, and the subroutines from the
files spmdinit.F90 and swap_comm.F90 into the spmd_utils module.  The
subroutine spmdinit has been modified to initialize these public variables
whether SPMD is defined or not.  Hence the "ifdef SPMD" conditional has
been removed from the call to spmdinit in the main cam program.

Because these variables are so widely used this change touches about 150
files.  Most the changes are only one or two lines of modified "use"
association statements.

Changes to CLM land-model: Add noland mode for adibatic,ideal_phys, aqua
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

Resolve the non-physics modes of CAM (adiabatic, ideal_phys, and aquaplanet) 
below the driver level, so that components know the appropriate action, but 
the driver isn't aware of it. Continue to use the common block for the data 
that signals this behavior, but move the behavior completely inside of ice, 
ocean or land surface models.

Also move the read of surface initial data and restart information outside 
of cam_intial and read_restart to methods just before surface model 
initialization. This means breaking up the restart so that intht is called 
later, the read_history is called later, and the close of nrg is done at this 
later step as well. Move the nrg unit numbers to wholy contained within the
relevent restart modules.

This actually allows CCSM mode to make use of ideal_phys, or adiabatic,
unlike previously where it wasn't a possiblity.

Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes

Changes made:

Some cleanup of the history module - mainly moving addfld and add_default
calls to the modules that are responsible for defining a quantity and
making outfld calls for it.  This gets rid of most of bldfld and h_default.
What remains of those subroutines has been merged into bldfld, and bldfld
has been moved into history_defaults.F90 which we expect to eventually go
away.  Also, the SCAM specific routines have been put into
history_scam.F90.  What's left in the history module is intended to be the
generic history module interface.

The functionality of the history module has been extended so that the
defined history files don't have to be sequential, e.g., a user can now
remove fincl2 from a namelist that contains specifications for fincl2 and
fincl3 without having to rename fincl3 to fincl2.  Previously the renaming
would have been necessary because having the 2nd history file empty when
the 3rd file was not empty was not allowed.  However, this new
functionality was not motivated by increased user convenience which is
pretty negligible.  The real reason for this change was to allow more
flexibility in where the calls are made to add fields to the initial file
which is just a special history file which is always the last one in the
list.  By allowing the list to contain empty files, the index of initial
file can now be terminal list index which is known at compile time, rather
than being the index that follows the last user or code defined history
file which isn't known until after processing all the add_default calls
which can occur at any point during the physics initialization.

precc_thresh and precl_thresh have been removed from the namelist.

Code reviewed by: myself, mvertens, eaton

Changes answers: Yes (same-physics)
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

	Get rid of all the #ifdef's refering to CAMSURF that went in with
	the cam3.2.3 tag.
	Basically, this tag gets the same answers as cam3.2.11 if you set

	#define CAMSURF CLIMATE_CAMSURF

	in misc.h and in configure script.

	The exception to this is that in this tag newiceproperties is
	still called at initialization
	in camice in camice_init. The reason for this is because there is
	some initializion
	that's important to do in newiceproperties.

	The code changes answers compared to cam3.2.11, and the changes
	were validated with
	simulations with FV and DOM at 4x5 resolution. Answers also change
	for SOM, but this
	wasn't verified.

	  /ERIK/csm/cam324_fv4x5dom_camsurf_1  --- Experiment based
		off cam3.2.4 (10 years)
	vs.
	  /ERIK/csm/cam321_fv4x5dom_1 -- control of cam3.2.1 (10
		years)

	Plots are available from

	http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/~erik/AMWG_diag/cam324_fv4x5dom_camsurf_1-cam321_fv4x5dom_1/

	The difference in the code is primarily to unify the merging of
	surface fields at
	timestep==0 with that done while time-stepping. And to unify how
	the ocean-ice
	diagnostic fluxes are calculated at time-step==0 with when
	time-stepping. Also in
	order to remove a dependency on the order that ocean and ice are
	called, I also use
	1-landfrac rather than ocnfrac as a mask for certain
	calculations. This changes
	answers for SOM at each time-step.

	The tests that fail have to do with bit-for-bit comparisions with
	cam3.2.11. Some
	of the bit-for-bit tests pass, if they run ideal-phys, adiabatic,
	or aqua-planet.
	Also error-growth tests are identical as error-growth is run in
	aqua-planet mode.

Changes answers: no, except roundoff introduce into FV
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes

Changes made:

Replace the original dynamics_vars.F90 by the new version.

Add performance mods for both Cray X1 and NEC SX (from Art Mirin and Pat Worley).

Clean up implementation of options for using platform optimized FFT
libraries (from Art Mirin and Pat Worley).

Remove SAVEd variables in cd_core.  This will come close to making the code
reentrant.

Explain failed tests:

These tests all failed due to a roundoff level changed introduced in the FV dycore.  Since no 
tests that had debug enabled failed, we assume this is an optimization issue.  The roundoff level
changes were verified by perturbation growth tests on both bluesky and bangkok, but only for
the configuration of tests bl351 and bl353.  Test bl336 is a waccm_mozart configuration and
the pergro test does not currently work there.

Changes made:

This is an incremental commit of mods to incorporate water isotopes into
CAM.  Added mods to manage the water isotope constituents.  Added mods to
allow the cloud sedimentation and ocean evaporation processes to act on
these constituents.

The regression test that fails is due to a bug in the FV dycore introduced
in cam3_2_8.  It has only been observed in pure OMP mode on the SGI.

Changes answers: spectral dycores are bit-for-bit, fv has roundoff change
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

Update the FV dycore to contain new code from the GEOS5 version.  The new
code includes derived types to encapsulate grid and state information.
Currently we've only used the grid type.  The dynamics state remains module
data in the prognostics module.  The new grid type replaces most of the
previous uses of the pmgrid and spmd_dyn modules although there is still
cleanup work to be done.  There was also a change in the polar filtering
code which introduces a roundoff level change in the FV simulations.  The
change was implemented as a bug fix to the problem that answers were
depending on the X decomposition when the 2D decomp option was used.

cam-bugs Requests resolved: none
Requires change in build system: yes (new clm cpp variable added)
Substantial timing or memory changes: no (unless CN code is activated)
Requires change in run script: all clm surface datasets have changed

Code reviewed by: myself, 
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: new-climate
Changes to CLM land-model: Yes (see below)
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

The following code changes accompany the incorporation
of new CLM code - clm_expa_29 - into the stand-alone CAM
development code base. As part of these changes, new CLM 
raw datasets were used to create the clm model surface
datasets. All CLM surface datasets were regenerated using 
the new raw datasets. In addition, clm3_expa_29 also contains the 
the incorporation of the carbon-nitrogen cycle into the CLM code base
(both Peter Thornton's CN model and the CASA carbon cycle model). 	
A detailed summary of climate changing modifications appears below.
Finally, clm3_expa_29, contains the flexibility, for the first time,
to run dynamic land use runs using prescribed land use datasets.
	
Note that generating clm surface datasets is now accomplished 
via an offline tool in mksrfdata/tools/mksrfdat. This is not 
part of the standard cam clm/tools directory yet
due to the current structure of the cam cvs module. 
This will be incorporated into cam in a subsequent cam checkin.
	
Validation simulations were carried out for 1979-2000 with annually varying SSTs.

The tags used for hyd_clm3_1 were cam3_1_7 and clm3_expa_29
(camroot = /fis/cgd/cseg/people/mvertens/src/cam/cam3_1_7_clm3_expa_29)

The changes between hyd_clm3_1 and hyd_con were:
o New SST dataset (amipbc_sst_T42_1949_2004.nc as opposed to sst_HadOIBl_bc_64x128_1949_2001_c020411.nc)
o Albedo calculation in CLM moved to end of second biophysics loop
o Peter Thornton's 2-leaf canopy model
o Peter Lawrence's MODIS-based surface dataset (distribution of plant
  functional types, LAI, and soil color)
o David Lawrence's and Peter Thornton's hydrology modifications (includes
  new formulations for interception, infiltration (surface runoff), soil
  moisture effects on stomatal conductance, soil to canopy air space transfer
  coefficients, soil hydraulic conductivity, and baseflow.

Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

Merge latest WACCM development code.

There is a new feature in the FV tracer code (trac2d.F90) which allows the
timestep splitting to differ in different vertical layers.  This feature is
currently only enabled for the WACCM_MOZART configuration since it can
introduce answer changes into the standard CAM FV configurations.

Add LAPACK_LIBDIR macro to Makefile to allow specifying the location of the
LAPACK and BLAS libraries.  Optional use is made of these libraries in
WACCM specific code (on AIX only).

Add the use of the massv library to the AIX section of the Makefile.  The
use of this library introduces roundoff level differences into the
simulation when changing the parallel configuration.  This library is only
used in WACCM_MOZART specific code.

In the IRIX64 section of the Makefile the -cpp option was replaced with
-macro_expand.  A WACCM_MOZART ifdef which was including code in a
multi-line data statement was failing to compile otherwise.

cam3_1_3
Originator: eaton ( Brian Eaton)
Date: Thu Mar 31 08:51:32 MST 2005
Model: CAM
Version: CAM3.1.3
One-line Summary: move control of rad calcs into rad module.  pathscale & g95 builds
cam-bugs Requests resolved: bugzilla IDs 4, 10, 13
Requires change in build system: no
Substantial timing or memory changes: no
Requires change in run script: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM (create_ccsmcam): no, currently broken
Tested to work with SCAM (tools/scam/testscript): yes
Machines tested: IBM, SGI, Linux-Lahey
Ran test-model.pl script: no
Tested on fv dynamics: yes
Tested on eul dynamics: yes
Tested on sld dynamics: yes
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested multiple constituents: yes
Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Tested in adiabatic mode: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes

Changes made:

Consolidate control of radiation calculations in the radiation module.
This includes resposibility for maintaining the namelist variables iradsw,
iradlw, iradae, and irad_always, and providing a function for the values
dosw, dolw, doabsems, and aeres.  These variables have all been removed
from comctl.h.

Add bugfix for turbulent mountain stress code.

Add files to DefaultCAMEXPNamelist.xml needed for WACCM runs at 1.9x2.5
resolution.

Add Makefile sections and ESMF build to support pathscale and g95 compilers
on linux systems.

Replace the PGF90 CPP macro with NO_R16.  The PGF90 macro was being used to
indicate that the compiler doesn't support quad precision.  But that's also
the case for the pathscale and g95 compilers.  The use of a generic CPP
token allows new compilers to be supported by modifying the the Makefile to
specify the compiler properties without requiring source code modification.

The g95 compiler doesn't recognize the cray pointer syntax in fv/geopk.F90.
The use of cray pointers there can't be trivially replaced by F90 pointers.
Since the cray pointers only appear in the geopk16 routine which is not
used by default, a CPP token NO_CRAY_POINTERS is defined for g95 and used
to stub out geopk16.  endrun is called if the user sets the namelist
variable (geopktrans) to use geopk16 when NO_CRAY_POINTERS is defined.

Add bugfix to cmfmca pointed out by David Noone.  This only affects the
simulation of tracers using dry mixing ratio (none by default).  The set of
test tracers enabled by setting the namelist variable
tracers_flag=.true. use a dry mixing ratio and are affected by this fix.

Model: CAM
Version: CAM3.0.33
One-line Summary: Enable new timing lib.
cam-bugs Requests resolved: none
Requires change in build system: Maybe for CCSM.
Substantial timing or memory changes: Yes: on IBM timer overhead decreases
                                      by as much as 10x. On SGI by 2x. On
                                      Cray X1 by 3x. No speedup on Linux.
Requires change in run script: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM (create_ccsmcam): yes but it failed. Told 
                                                   to go ahead with commit.

Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: timer init calls and fortran include file changed.
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB? yes

Changes made:

o Replace timer code in utils/timing with new more effecient version. Better
  performance results from replacing a linked list search for timer names
  with a simple hash table. The new library now prints per-timer overhead
  estimates. It can also interface with the PAPI low level performance 
  counter library. A brief description of how to do so is included in 
  utils/timing/README.

o The old interface names (t_xxx) were retained. But these should be changed
  to the new names (gptlxxx) as soon as possible.

o Modify CAM Makefile for optimal performance on Cray X1.

Topography fields (mods from Byron Boville)
===========================================

These mods are to read the topo fields (PHIS, SGH, SGH30, LANDFRAC,
LANDM_COSLAT) from their own file.  They are no longer written to the
output initial files.  Backwards compatibility is maintained by looking for
the topo fields on the initial file if a topo file is not specified using
the new namelist variable bnd_topo.  There are also mods to write the names
of the initial, topo, and sst files into global attributes of the history
files.

An initial set of topo files have been created by extracting the topo
fields from the initial files currently specified in
DefaultCAMEXPNamelist.xml.  The topo files are in the data directory
$CSMDATA/atm/cam/topo/.  These files will eventually be replaced by a set
of standard files that contain detailed metadata describing how the fields
were produced.

There are also modifications and cleanup in the definehires and definesurf
utilities.  Added alot of information to the README files for both utils.

Misc
====

. Re-insert a fix in phys_grid.F90 (transpose_chunk_to_block)
  changing the chunk_buffer arg to intent(in).

. In history.F90 increase pflds to 2000 and tbl_hash_oflow_percent to 10.

Changes made:

A models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/eul/massfix.F90
Currently a module that just holds hw1, hw2, hw3, alpha. Could facilitate
a separation between mass fix and the timefilter.

M slt/qmassa.F90 
Now a module, old subroutine qmassa is now qmassarun. Added an
optional argument pdeld to be used to calculate hw1lat for dry
mixing-ratio constituents. 

M control/history.F90
moved addfld and add_defualt for PDELDRY from here to physics/cam1/diagnostics.F90

M eul/dp_coupling.F90
Added transfer of pdeld from p->d,d->p. Calculation of pdeld moved to
tfilt_massfix.F90 instead of call to set_state_pdry.

M eul/inital.F90
added initialization of dynamics variable pdeld

M eul/prognostics.F
added dynamics variable pdeld, only allocated when dry constituents
are present

M eul/restart_dynamics.F90
added pdeld to restart files

M eul/scan2.F90
moved public hw1, hw2, hw3, alpha to new module massfix.F90
pass pdeld to tfilt_massfixrun()

M eul/scandyn.F90
pass pdeld to qmassarun

M eul/scanslt.F90
pass pdeld to qmassarun

M eul/stepon.F90
pass pdeld to d_p_coupling

M eul/tfilt_massfix.F90
Calculate time filtered value of pdeldry; use this to time-filter dry
constituents conservatively.

M sld/scanslt.F90
change qmassa call to new name: qmassarun

M sld/tfilt_massfix.F90
save water vapor for use in next timestep; this was inadvertently
removed in cam3_0_28 and is necessary for dry mass conservation

M physics/constituents.F90
new public logical cnst_need_pdeldry. Default is flase, set to true if 
any constituents are dry.

M physics/convect_deep.F90
only use pdeldry when needed

M physics/diagnostics.F90
addfld and outfld calls for PSDRY and PDELDRY only when needed

M physics/icarus_scops.F90
added r8 to reals

M physics/physics_types.F90
added state%pdeldry  and related to methods only when needed
added optional argument pdeld_calc (default=true) to subroutine
set_state_pdry, setting false still calculates related fields but
doesn't change state%pdeldry itself.

M physics/physpkg.F90
diagnostic subroutine gavglook only calculates dry quantities when
needed

M physics/tracers_suite.F90
added missing r8

o Enable "mkrgrid" utility to work under lf95, ifort, and Cray X1.
o Enable "interpaerosols" utility for reduced grid, and Cray X1.
o Add new utility "mkrgridnew", which can replace "mkrgrid" when IC files
  are xyz. The new utility is simpler, and unlike mkrgrid works on ISCCP
  history files and on Cray X1.
o Check for reduced grid in optional boundary dataset reading routines 
  for which reduced grid capability is not yet enabled (e.g. dust module) 
  and abort in reduced grid mode.
o When CAM reads SST and aerosol data, ensure that boundary dataset grids 
  match cam grid.
o Delete threading directives from ccsm_msg.F90 per mvertens.

Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Tested in adiabatic mode: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: 

- Changes are round-off for EUL (except for aqua-planet which has a new climate
                                   because of a change in the dry airmass constant)
    Changes are BFB for SLD (except for aqua-planet which has a new climate)
    Changes are BFB for FV (except for aqua-planet which has a new climate)

Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:


  - Add fields to the master field list which complete the heat, moisture, cloud
    liquid water, cloud liquid ice, and precip budgets

      (no new *default* fields are added to the History file)

  - Add an attribute ("sampling_seq") to those fields on a NetCDF History File
    which are *not* based on an every-time-step sampling frequency.  The
    attribute would have a descriptive value indicating its sampling sequence.
    Currently only one value is added:  "rad_lwsw" (for fields that are only
    sampled at LW/SW radiation time steps).  No code is currently being added to
    fill these fields with "missing" values.

  - Replace the "RAD_FIRST_HOUR" namelist variable with "IRAD_ALWAYS".
    "RAD_FIRST_HOUR" was a logical that was too inflexible.  "IRAD_ALWAYS" is an
    integer that specifies length of time in timesteps (positive) or hours
    (negative) that the SW/LW radiation will be run continuously from the start
    of an initial run.
 
  - For aqua-planet runs, dry mass is hard-wired to 101325.-245. ( = 101080.) Pa

  - Bug fixes:

      - Fix a potential bug in the history module that would end up clobbering
        the creation of the IC file if *all* the fields added to an auxiliary
        history file through "add_default" calls are then excluded via FEXCL in
        the namelist.

      - Fix bug that corrupts high resolution runs:  promote "n" to I8 when
        doing n**4 and n**3 math in hdinti, hordif1, and phcs.

      - Correct the logic in the aerosol data interpolator as reported by 
        Jim Boyle on the CGD forum

      - make "jstrt_p" private in SCAN2 and REALLOC7 loops
  
      - bugfix for adiabatic restarts

Changes to CLM land-model: fixed reduced grid support in one routine
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

Fixed support for reduced grid (Jim Rosinski):
  - control/readinitial.F90
  - physics/cam1/prescribed_aerosols.F90
  - dynamics/eul/initcom.F90
  - lnd/clm2/src/main/surfFileMod.F90

Additional reduced grid support modifications (for the X1
only?). Zeroing out unused locations in the FFT buffers is required
on the X1. 
  - dynamics/eul/linemsdyn.F90
  - dynamics/eul/spegrd.F90
  - dynamics/sld/spegrd.F90
  - dynamics/sld/scanslt.F90

Added new runtime option, dyn_equi_by_col, to improve performance of
spectral dycores when using reduced grid. When set to .true., it
attempts to allocate the same number of columns to each process in the
dynamics rather than the same number of latitude lines. For a full
grid, these goals are identical. The option is on by default. However,
it is not necessarily the best choice when using a reduced grid on a
vector system. Setting it to .false. executes the old code,
equidistributing the number of latitude lines whether using a full or
a reduced grid. 
 1) Moved decompinit out of cam, into readinitial.F90 and restart.F90,
    so that reduced grid option could be identifed before computing
    dynamics decomposition 
    - control/cam.F90
    - control/readinitial.F90
    - control/restart.F90
 2) Added dyn_equi_by_col runtime option
    - control/runtime_opts.F90
    - dynamics/eul/spmd_dyn.F90 
    - dynamics/sld/spmd_dyn.F90 
    - dynamics/fv/spmd_dyn.F90
 3) Added dyn_equi_by_col domain decomposition
    - dynamics/eul/spmd_dyn.F90
    - dynamics/sld/spmd_dyn.F90

The SLD dycore does not have all of the modifications made to EUL in
Jan.-March, 2004 to, for example, decrease memory requirements in the
spectral domain. The following files were modified as a step toward
implementing these changes. The motivation is that including these
changes allows the SLD version of spmd_dyn.F90 to be almost identical
to that used in EUL.
  - dynamics/sld/comspe.F90
  - dynamics/sld/scanslt.F90

The current Co-Array Fortran logic in CAM requires that the two
communication buffers allocated in the spectral dycores be the same
size. This is currently true when the number of processors divides the
latitudes, but not otherwise. Since this may  be important for other
one-sided messaging systems as well, the following files have been
modified  to require that all processes allocate the same size
communcation buffers. Note that this has no performance impact in
normal CAM usage (and probably never has an impact).

Reinsert compiler directive fixing Cray X1 bug that was lost in
a previous check-in 
  - control/history.F90

The routine sort_chunks is called in create_chunks and
orders the columns assigned to a chunk.
It was added to phys_grid.F90 back when we were looking for
alternatives to the buffer copies introduced into radcswmx.F90 for
vectorization. A bug in this code was recently identified. Rather than
fix it, we have decided that sort_chunks does nothing useful even when
working correctly. Thus the routine sort_chunks has been removed.

 - physics/cam1/phys_grid.F90

Miscellaneous bug fixes:

 1) A typo in the existing "equidistribute by latitudes"
    decomposition logic was fixed. Fortunately, this bug 
    was never seen in practice.

set OFFLINE_DYN C preprocessor flag.

Namelist variables added: 

  met_data_file        The filepath of the netCDF file
                       containing the meteorology data
  
  met_cell_wall_winds  Set to true if the meteorology winds are
                       defined on model cell walls.

The offline meteorology data can be read from a sequence of files
provided the files are named stringNNN.nc, where NNN is an integer
of any number of digits.  If the data is contained in a series of
files, the files need to be named sequentially, e.g., metdata001.nc,
metdata002.nc, metdata003.nc, etc.

Code reviewed by: myself
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no 
Changes to CLM land-model: None 
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

1) Fixed bug in assign_chunks identified by Steve Ghan and Tim Shippert. This
   bug did not affect execution in the standard modes of operation.

2) Fixed UNICOS/MP Makefile option for cam3_0_20 changes.

3) Communication optimizations:

  - eliminated overlap implementations of realloc and dp_coupling
    communications. All that was being overlapped was buffer copies,
    which did not appear to be useful on the current target platforms.

  - added "alternative" implementations of alltoall and allgather
    (used in realloc routines and dp_coupling), using
    1) one of a large number of MPI-2 point-to-point commands,
       controlled by swap_comm_order, swap_comm_protocol, and
       swap_comm_maxreq. The first two parameters have the same
       meaning as before. swap_comm_maxreq controls the maximum number
       of outstanding send/receive requests allowed in the
       implementation of alltoall/allgather. This can be used to tune
       performance or work around bugs on systems that do
       not tolerate large numbers of outstanding requests well.
    2) MPI-2 put commands
    3) Co-Array Fortran remote writes

    #2 is important for performance on the Earth Simulator. The others
    represent defensive programming, for situations in which the MPI
    collectives are not implemented efficiently. #2 also seems to be
    fastest on the Cray X1, but I haven't not done a careful study yet.

  - To support the MPI-2 implementation, replaced original
    communication buffer logic
    * call spmdbuf in spmdinit_dyn to allocate communication buffers;
      call spmdbuf_resize in d_p_coupling or in p-d_coupling to
      reallocate communication buffers is they are not large enough
    with
     * call spmdbuf in inital or in restart, after phys_grid_init, to
       allocate communication buffers of the appropriate size the
       first time, then use MPI_WINCREATE to enable remote
       read/write from/to these buffers.

  - For the SLD dycore, added minor modifications originally
    introduced into the EUL dycore to improve vectorization. This
    makes realloc5, realloc5, and realloc7 almost identical between
    the EUL and SLD dycores again, and should improve vectorization
    for the SLD dycore.

  The new runtime options for dyn_alltoall, dyn_allgather, and
  phys_alltoall are:

  0: use collectives
  1: use MPI-2 point-to-point, as specified by swap_comm_order,
     swap_comm_protocol, swap_comm_maxreq. (swap_comm_maxreq default
     is -1, meaning no limit; >0 sets the upper bound)
  2: if compiled with -DMPI2, then use MPI-2 put implementation, else
     use an MPI_SENDRECV implementation
  3: if compiled with -DCAF, then use Co-Array remote write
     implementation, else use an MPI_SENDRECV implementation

  Files modified are as follows:

control/restart.F90
  added call to spmdbuf
control/runtime_opts.F90
  added swap_comm_maxreq parameter
control/swap_comm.F90
  added swapm, swap_comm_maxreq;

Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

Move cam3_0_18_brnchT_nohalo9 to cam_dev.

	Isolate extended grid information to SLT advection to only
	within Spectral dy-cores.

Use plon(regular grid) instead of plond(extended grid) except for 
SLT variables, inside of relevent dynamics.

Eulerian:

  scanslt becomes a module with alloc, initial, run and final phases.

  Remove comslt and move data to inside of scanslt or scan2.

  scanslt has a advection_state data-type to keep track of all extended 
  grid information. All data on the extended grid are kept inside of this 
  state. Dynamics data iscopied into and then out of this state for advection.

  New dimension for FFT -- plondfft.
       
  spetru has new temporary variables inside of it so it can be dimensioned 
  the right size for FFT (plondfft).

  linemsdyn becomes a module and scan2 becomes a module

  Make grdini, grdxy, sltb1, and sltini module subroutines of scanslt.

SLD:
  scanslt becomes a module with: alloc, initial, run_setup, run, and 
  final phases. Extended grid parameters moved from pmgrid and rgrid to
  inside of this module. Much of the data becomes private inside of 
  scanslt module. Create advection_state data type to keep track of all 
  extended grid data, copy data into this structure and then out of
  for the rest of the dynamics

  comslt removed and data moved to inside of scanslt. grmult becomes a module.
  Use inf instead of nan for initialization.

  Spmd_dyn data only used for bndexch moved as private data inside of scanslt.

  Make bndexch, grdini, grdxy, sltlinint, slttraj, sltwgts, and trajdp 
  module subroutines of scanslt.

test-model.pl

	Fix problem where couldn't change resolution on comand line
	with -skip option (cam-bug 147).

	Add -cppdefs option

	Restart tests done at default compiler option rather than explicitly
	set to production compiler settings. This allows the use of the "-debug"
	option to override the default setting for testing where this is
	useful.

SCAM:
	Improve readability of testscript, send output to log files
	and have the script clean up after itself better. Use plon instead
	of plond.

Performance changes: (Following tests were done with earlier versions
		      on no-halo branch based off of cam3_0_9 for eul and 
		      cam3_0_15 for sld test)
	Eul@T42 on IBM same
	Eul@T85 on IBM with 11 constituents 3% slower
	Sld@T42 on IBM 2% faster

Changes made:

Create an new radiation/constituent interface.  This functionality (for gas
phase constituents) previously resided in the chemistry module.  It has
been reimplemented in it's own module (rad_constituents.F90) to facilitate
swapping in new chemistry code without having to duplicate the control
logic in another chemistry module.  Also, the new module can be extended to
coordinate control of the aerosol constituents.

Modified the constituents module:
1) Add an optional argument to cnst_add to allow specifying that the
   default outfld calls for that constituent should not be made.  This
   allows, for example, the chemistry module to output volume mixing
   ratios rather than the default mass mixing ratios.
2) Add an optional argument to cnst_get_ind to allow it to return an error
   status rather than just aborting if the requested name is not found in
   the constituent array.

Add a bugfix to cldwat.F90.  Some variables needed initializers.  Only
caused a problem if the top of the model was above 1mb.

Create a new module (ghg_defaults.F90) for the default ghg distributions
computed by trcmix.

Added lat and lon (radians) to the physics_state data type.

Add a method to the ozone_data module to return a pointer to the
interpolated data.

Returned the chemistry module to its previous functionality of just
providing prognostic ghg distributions using a simple production/loss
chemistry.

Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

This checkin introduces a new utility, definehires, that can be used to process
USGS 30 second topographic data and produce a 10-minute dataset suitable for 
use with definesurf.
It is located in the directory:
cam1/models/atm/cam/tools/definehires/README

The following files were modified to accomodate a new input dataset
      field (SGH30) that represents the variance of the 30-second
      height data on the 10-minute grid.  This supplements the field
      SGH, which represents the variance of the 10-minute mean heights
      on the model grid.  Both definesurf and CAM can still use the
      old datasets with no change in answers from the current code.
      In the case of CAM, if SGH30 is not present, the model will use
      SGH in its place (as it currently does), but SGH30 will be used
      if found.

Changes answers: Yes, same-to-roundoff
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

The non-water gas phase constituents that are required by the radiation
codes are O3, CO2, CH4, N2O, CFC11, CFC12.  All these constituents, except
CO2, are now accessed only via the chemistry module.  A single method,
chem_get_cnst, returns constituent values regardless of whether they are
prognostic variables from the constituent array, or are diagnosed or
interpolated from a dataset.  So all the logic for determining where a
constituent comes from now lives in the top level chemistry interface and
not in the top level radiation interface.

CO2 is a special case because it is assumed by the radiation algorithms to
be a single global value.  For now it is still accessed directly from the
ghg_surfvals module.  We expect this to change in the future.

These changes are roundoff due to the decision that chem_get_cnst should
return values as mass mixing ratio.  Previously O3 values were accessed
from the interpolation routine as volume mixing ratio and converted to
mass mixing ratio as needed.  The change in where this conversion happens
introduced a roundoff level difference.

Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

This checkin adds a column radiation model to the SCAM, and also
contains a variety of general fixes/enhancements to SCAM, mostly
centered around allowing it to work with nonstandard numbers of model
levels. Details follow...


Addition of the column radiation model:
---------------------------------------

The CRM can operate on old-style text CRM input files, or on a model
state initialized via any of scam's existing methods.

The CRM has both non-gui and gui modes.  The gui version is accessed
via a new page under scam's "Options" tab.  The non-gui version is
accessed via a shell script named crm.

I modified testscript to test the crm.
The following output from the test script indicates a pass (both lines
must be present):

scam passed its bfb test.
CRM passed.


General scam modifications:
---------------------------

Scam now honors the use_srfprop flag.

To facilitate running at nonstandard numbers of levels:
  scam now guesses the appropriate level-dependent pressure file to use.
  ncdio_atm.F90 has been modified to interpolate/extrapolate data to
    the scam levels if necessary.

Handling of defaults files and quickstart files is slightly more robust.

Scam now plots interface level fields correctly.

Buffer sizes have been increased to allow scam to use up to 300 levels.

The gui's configure script has been modified to remove an unnecessary
dependency on libg2c when not using ncar graphics

I fixed an unitialized value problem in readiopdata.F90.

I modified init_model.F90 to handle C-to-fortran string passing
according to the unix standard.

I modified the scam testscript to retry (up to 10 times) on
compilation failures to try to overcome our persisent license server
problems. 

I added a sanity check on precab(i) to cldwat.F90.

Updated init_model.F90 to reference ozone_data.F90 instead of comozp.F90.

Lastly, I removed 7 Mb of apparently unneeded ncar graphics files from
the repository.

  (radlw.F90), and shortwave radiation (radsw.F90).

  The old radini which initialized the old common block crdcon contained a
  couple of constants which differed from the share constants.  In order to
  have a bit-for-bit commit the old values have been maintained.

. Add pointer variables inside radiation_tend to provide flexible method of
  passing either prescribed or prognostic constituents to the radiation
  calcs.

. Removed the common block ptrrgrid.h which was not being used.

. Added some FV 10x15 datasets to the Default*Namelist.xml files.

. Added back 13 files that were lost during the cam3_0_9 commit.

Minor mods (listed above) to CAM Makefile, timing print routine, CLM
routines, and ESMF to enable CAM to build and run on Linux machines using
Intel compiler suite.  2-day error growth test using ifort and icc passed at
T42 in EUL configuration.

ESMF upgraded to ESMF_0_0_6 per Erik Kluzek.  No code changes, but support
added for linux_intel and linux_altix.  Note that linux_intel assumes that
Fortran and C compilers are both Intel (ifort and icc respectively).  Though
CAM can be configured (and will run) with gcc, there is little point in doing
this as of this commit since ESMF will still require icc.

Minor mods to CLM routines to allow compilation with ifort.

Addition of an "fclose" to timing print routine t_pr.c to force a buffer
flush.  Without it icc was truncating its printed output of model timers.


IMPORTANT: the only configurations of Intel compiler suite and underlying
glibc library that proved successful were:

ifort >= 8.0.046
icc >= 8.0.055
glibc >= 2.3.x

Tests in which not all these conditions were met resulted in various
failures, including general compiler errors, internal compiler errors, and
segmentation faults.

Notes:

o In general the Intel compilers create code that runs fast.  Compile times
for optimized code (-O2) can be fairly long.

o The debugger (idb) is line-based.  Hopefully it can be used in conjunction
with ddd to give a window-based option.

o Hybrid OpenMP/MPI configuration with Intel compilers was tested and does
work.  Little timing difference compared with pure-MPI was observed.
Depending on model conifiguration, manipulation of environment variable
KMP_STACKSIZE may be required to avoid seg faults when threading is enabled. 

o Tests enabling floating point traps (-fpe0) did not work in SPMD mode, so
this option was not included in Makefile mods.  Hopefully the code changes
required to enable this option will be minor.

Changes made:


--------------

   Description of changes:

 - The history.F90 module is modified to include the Initial Conditions file as
   part of the general history file build process.  Details:

     - the IC file is formatted exactly like a history file.
     - just as in other history files, the IC file is filled via calls to
       "outfld".
     - no time averaging;  fields are always instantaneous
     - only one time sample written to file
     - accumulation/output is in double precision
     - "ptapes" increased from 6 to 7
     - IC file is indexed "mtapes" in the history module (always at end of
       active history file list)
     - name of file includes ".i." rather than ".hX."

     - two namelist parameters control the building of the IC file:

           - INITHIST:  controls frequency of IC file writes (for both land and
                        atmosphere):  '6-HOURLY, 'DAILY', 'MONTHLY', 'YEARLY' or
                        'NONE'
           - INITHIST_ALL:  .false.:  dump ONLY required fields to IC file
                            .true. :  dump required AND optional fields to IC
                                      file (DEFAULT)
     - setting "EMPTY_HTAPES = .true." does NOT prevent the IC file from being
       created.
     - only setting INITHIST = 'NONE' prevents the IC file from being created.
     - no space allocated on history buffer if INITHIST = 'NONE'
     - the old IC file build routine, "write_inithist" is removed

     - Note: - In an Eulerian run, the new code does not produce identical IC
	       files as the old code.  The values for QCWAT, TCWAT, LCWAT, and
               CLD will be different.

             - In adiabatic mode, the FV dycore *still* does not create an IC
               file with the proper temperature on it.  In adiabatic mode, FV
               does not update temperature.  Therefore, the IC file will
               contain the wrong temperature.

 - History (and IC) fieldnames can be up to 16 characters long

 - inidat.F90 re-written for all dycores.  All fields are now read and processed
   one at a time, reducing memory costs.  All reads are done via a call to a
   single netCDF interface (modified version of module written for the Land
   Model by Mariana Vertenstein).

 - inidat.F90 is backward compatible with OLD IC files.

 - EUL and SLD spetru.F90 modules modified to be identical to eachother

 - another new namelist variable:  

    RAD_FIRST_HOUR:  Flag to force model to compute full radiation every
                     timestep in the first model hour (for use in
                     "forecast/analysis" runs)
	             Default:  .false.

 - restart files will change (because of extra characters for each field)

 - Removed code associated with HADVTEST and VADVTEST cpp tokens ("blob" test)

 - Bugfixes in aqua-planet mode:

     - the field "landm" is now set to 0.  Changes answers; new climate for
       aqua-planet.
     - fixed bug in analytical SST specification (in a branch of code not run
                                                  by default model)
 - Bugfix to test-model.pm provided by Erik.

Synopsis:

Overall this is a major refactoring of test-model.pl. This is the version
of test-model.pl that was on the subroutinization branch for the last year.
This improves the default behavior of test-model.pl and makes it easier
and more flexible to use. It also provides for the ability to test the
test-model.pl test harness.

Add abilities needed by new test-model.pl. Don't delete *.f90 files.
Delete lsmexp.pm file. Make run options more clear. Add printlev and test
option to namelist. Build_namelist always does a new on a namelist
object. Get rid of check-namelist.pl as not used.

M models/atm/cam/test/system/test-model.pl  

New version of test-model.pl as described below.

M models/atm/cam/tools/newcprnc/Makefile                  

Allow use of env variables needed by test-model.pl. Still not used in

Bug-fixes from Mariana for DGVM.

Details of changes to test-model.pl

test-model.pl -- new version with XML files to control tests that     
        are run. This is the version of test-model.pl that was        
        used on the subroutinization branch. Modified batch scripts   
        to correspond to new command line options.                    
                                                                      
Default is changed so that if you are comparing and a test is         
NOT bit-for-bit to the comparision code -- test-model.pl will         
stop.                                                                 
                                                                      
New command line options to test-model.pl
                                                                      
-cleanonly           = only clean files out                                   
-help_defaults       = Create file with configuration/namelist information 
                       for all tests                                          -allow_nonb4bcompare = Allow comparisions not bit-for-bit to continue.
-[no]spmd            = Turn on [off] SPMD mode                       
-[no]smp             = Turn on [off] SMP mode
-nocompareifskipped  = If you are skipping tests a comparision will NOT
                       be run if a given test is skipped.                     -namelist "namelist" = Reads in namelist and adds these options to the 
                       namelists that are used.                            
-testonly            = Only test test-model.pl running configure and 
                       build-namelist for all tests to demonstrate what 
                       test-model.pl would have produced.
-testslist filename  = Use the given XML file of tests rather 
                       than the default file.                              

Information on all command-line options is given with

test-model.pl -help
                                                                      
newcprnc -- Add ability to use the env variables needed for test-model.pl
	VPATH, EXEDIR. To use this in test-model.pl change the path
	in test-model.pl and change CAM_test.pm to NOT use the "-m" option
	as the behavior of this flag was reversed in newcprnc from cprnc.

Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

Get rid of ncdata_vers stuff in the build-namelist scripts.

Fix bug in SOM comparisions, so test-model.pl will flag a difference
if SOM code changes. Previously this aspect was broken and the comparisions
files were mislabled. Now the files are properly labeled, SOM control
tests are made in a seperate directory, and namelist and configuration
variables are consistent such that the comparision is valid. This problem
was documented as cam-bug #118.

No code was changed only build and configuration and test scripts.

Changes to CLM land-model: rename STATICEcosysDynMod.F90 --> STATICEcosystemDynMOD.F90
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

1. Merge of vector and scalar code branches:

The mods for the NEC that didn't change answers (bit-for-bit) were
committed previously.  This set of mods introduces a roundoff level
change into the simulation.  The main modifications are:

. A new version of radcswmx.  This code runs a little slower on the IBM
  (about 4% of total run time).  It introduces roundoff level changes
  which affects all dycores.

. Large sections of code have been changed which reorder the spectral
  calculations in the EUL dycore.  We observed no performance degradation
  on the IBM from this change.

. Most of the Cray optimizations have been included as well.  They are mainly
  compiler directives.

2. Rename a CLM file which didn't match the module name it contained (this
   breaks the dependency generator)

3. Some cleanup in ncar_batch.csh

Changes made:

. Fix hack in test-model that set F_OPTIMIZATION_OVERRIDE for certain PGI
  tests.  The hack was broken by the inclusion of a commandline option to
  configure for setting the F_OPTIMIZATION_OVERRIDE macro in the Makefile.
. Add print in test-model output to tells which log contains NOT BFB
  message.
. Various configure/Makefile changes:
  - Temporarily remove -Mbounds from PGI debug options.  CLM2 is not working
    with this option.
  - Add -cppdefs option to configure for defining CPP tokens.  These cpp
    definitions are appended to the Makefile defaults.  Remove the -precomp
    option which was adding #define lines to misc.h.
  - Add capability to configure to determine the name of the MPI library
    being used.  This is currently most useful for Linux which may use
    either mpi or mpich as the library name.
  - Clean up Linux section of Makefile.  Fixed a bug which broke the build
    if the user specified the option '-fc pgf90' to configure.  Remove
    options for compilers that don't have corresponding builds of the ESMF
    library.
. Add missing addfld call for H2O2DRY in sulfur_intr.F90

Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

o Merged cam2.0.2.dev67.brnchT.nec15 (vector branch) changes that do not affect 
  answers onto cam_dev.  Opted for Pat Worley's dev68 communication mods over NEC
  communication mods where conflicts occurred.  A few NEC_SX ifdefs still
  exist in the committed code.  Most involve reversing "do k" and "do i"
  loops in dynamics routines for vectorization.  An inner loop over k results
  in a non-unit-stride situation on scalar machines and should be avoided.
  That is why these code portions were left ifdef'd

o Note 1: The code appears to be good to roundoff on IBM machines when NEC_SX is 
  #define'd.  To test this on an IBM, "! defined AIX" needs to be added in 2
  obvious places in cfort.h and abortutils.F90
  
o Note 2: An odd behavior was discovered whereby inconsistent chunck indices are
  printed from ice_srf.F90 at times when the ice temperature profile is reset to
  linear.  This behavior appears to only manifest when threads * tasks exceeds
  the number of physical CPUs available.  It was decided to commit without
  resolving this discrepancy because the behavior occurs in the base model and
  in earlier libraries, i.e. independent of the NEC vector mods.

Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

(A) mod_comm has been significantly streamlined to make it easier to
understand the coding; module mod_irreg has been combined into mod_comm;
option to dynamically allocate target window has been added.
More work still needs to be done. Most of the changes in the FV routines
are due to the new linkage.

(B) the utils/pilgrim subdirectory can now be included for all 3 dycores;
this requires setting the if-def MODCM_DP_TRANSPOSE. Consequently,
the mod_comm option for the dynamics/physics transposes in phys_grid
is now operational with all 3 dycores;

(C) namelist variable modcomm_method has been fissioned into 2 new
namelist variables - modcomm_transpose and modcomm_geopk; these are
applicable to the FV dycore.

(D) the namelist variable phys_alltoall is now overloaded when applicable
to mod_comm; its new value is 11 + (mod_comm method), where (mod_comm method)
can have values from 0 to 3; see code documentation in phys_grid.

Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:


1) Removed PVP ifdefs (to make merge with vector branches cleaner). Files affected:
   control/cam.F90, rgrid.F90

   dynamics/eul/comspe.F90, dyn.F90, dyndrv.F90, grcalc.F90, hordif.F90,
                inital.F90, initcom.F90, quad.F90, settau.F90, spetru.F90,

                initcom.F90, quad.F90, spetru.F90, trunc.F90, tstep.F90,
                tstep1.F90, vertnm.F90

2) Reimplemented communication algorithms in spectral dycore realloc routines
   and in the physics load balancing, using either MPI collectives or
   point-to-point implementations that use the swap_comm module. swap_comm
   was imported from PSTSWM and PCCM, and supports 28 different options. The default
   is to use collectives. When not using collectives, the default is to use the
   original point-to-point algorithm (using mpi_sendrecv). Runtime options
   dyn_alltoall, dyn_allgather, phys_alltoall, swap_comm_order, and swap_comm_protocol
   were added to runtime_options to specify these. For example,
   dyn_alltoall == 0 means to use MPI_Alltoallv in realloc4a and realloc4b.
   dyn_alltoall == 1 means to use one of the point-to-point algorithms.

   Physics load balancing was also changed to use the same communication buffer
   as that used by the realloc routines. Finally, the physics load balancing
   options were tweaked, primarily to remove a high complexity initialization algorithm
   that was dominating runtime for short runs at high resolution. Files affected:

   control/runtime_opts.F90, spmd_utils.F90, spmdinit.F90, swap_comm.F90, mpi_wrap.F90

   dynamics/eul/dp_coupling.F90, realloc4.F90, realloc7.F90, scan2.F90, spmd_dyn.F90

One-line Summary: Eliminate dead code, more flexible endrun, more "intent" attributes,
                  better lf95 strict error checking compliancy
cam-bugs Requests resolved: none
Requires change in build system: no
Substantial timing or memory changes: no

Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: None (one-line description)
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

o endrun is now in a module and takes an optional character string argument.
  If present, this string is printed before the model aborts.
o Eliminated dead code, including the old "dataicemodel".  Mods were made to
  ncar_batch.csh to eliminate the dataicemodel tests.  This was done by passing
  -skip all:1-17 to test-model.
o Also eliminated dead logic related to sulfur variables.
o Better strict error checking compliancy under lf95.  But "lf95 -x" cannot be
  used because lf95 warns that all underlying libraries must also be compiled
  with this option in order for it to work properly.
o Added "intent" clause to arguments where the proper value was clear.  The code 
  was already in pretty good shape w.r.t. all arguments having their intent 
  declared.  There are still a few places where intent needs to be added though.

Changes made:

This is the first of two successive archive updates. These changes are
bit-fot-bit.

Summary of changes:

Removal of mprun2d namelist. This involved creating routines
spmd_dyn_defaultopts and spmd_dyn_setopts with optional arguments. I
mimicked the procedure in phys_grid.F90. In runtime_opts.F90 I put
"dycore_is" test around the calls, and I created dummy versions in
dynamics/eul and dynamics/sld. The initial dummy versions were just
subroutine and end statements, with no arguments. However, the code would
not compile; there were complaints about inaccessible routines and
needing explicit interfaces with optional arguments. I ended up putting
'public' declarations in the EUL and SLD versions and using the same
argument list as with the FV version. (I think the key problem was the
argument list more than the public declaration.) I know it is our
intention to have different versions (with different arguments) of these
routines for the different dycores, but that clearly didn't work; the
present solution is out of expediency. I suspect that the fact that the
arguments are optional is central to the problem. I used optional
arguments only because that is what was done in phys_grid.F90. Also, one
of the namelist variables (modcomm_method) will eventually apply outside
of FV once we use mod_comm transposes outside of FV, so it will
eventually have to be moved or replicated.

Single coding path for 1-D and 2-D decompositions for FV dycore. TWOD_YZ
ifdef eliminated. The "xy" variables are always invoked (e.g., ptxy). The
twod_decomp variable now refers to whether or not transposes (versus
copies) are called to go between yz and xy decompositions; naturally
copies are relevant only for 1-D decomposition; for debugging purposes,
one can force transposes even with 1-D decomposition (see new namelist
variable force_2d). Also, there is a new FV runtime diagnostic (not
input) variable (called spmd_on) that indicates SPMD versus non-SPMD.

Method for FV transposes now runtime rather than compile time (although
the choice between ordinary MPI and MPI-2 is still compile-time). For
ordinary MPI, the choice is between invoking temporary contiguous buffers
versus using MPI derived types. The relevant namelist variable is
modcomm_method (0 for contiguous buffers, 1 for derived types (default)).
MPI-2 presently has 4 options (0,1(default),2,3) (options 0,1,2 use
contiguous buffer at target; 0 is for contiguous source buffers; 1 is for
direct MPI_put's of contiguous segments, with threading over the
segments; 2 is for MPI derived types at the source with threading over
target; option 3 is for MPI derived types at source and target, with
threading over target; option 3 involves re-definition of windows and is
probably not optimal). For MPI-2, one specifies "USE_MPI2" precompile
flag when configuring.

New configure option "-precomp <string>", where string is a non-empty
list of precompile flags to be placed in misc.h. For example, one can
specify "-precomp USE_MPI2" for MPI-2 mod_comm transposes.

Option to use nested OpenMP constructs for FV dycore on IBM. This must be
specified at compile time using new configure option "-nested_omp"; this
has effect on misc.h and the Makefile. In sw_core.F90 and tp_core.F90
(which are already threaded with respect to z), latitude loops are
threaded. The number of inner threads is the new namelist variable
"ompnest", which must divide evenly into the total number of threads; the
number of outer threads will be the total number of threads divided by
"ompnest". IBM's implementation is non-standard.

Option to use mod_comm for dynamics/physics transposes when using
load-balanced chunking. In phys_grid.F90, the "alltoall" flag is replaced
by new namelist variable "phys_transpose" (1 for original alltoall
(default), 2 for Pat Worley's send_and_receive, 3 for mod_comm). Because
mod_comm is presently compiled and linked only for FV, the mod_comm
option is presently valid only for FV; it must be activated at compile
time with the MODCM_DP_TRANSPOSE if-def (use precomp option in
configure).

Miscellaneous transpose improvements and code cleaning.

Deletion of configure_fv.pl and script.m4.

I also created the necessary surface data and aerosol files to support
the FV 0.5x0.625 resolution. The CAM and CLM default namelists were
updated accordingly. This required updating
tools/interpaerosols/REGRID.pl as well.

*****************************************************************
With the removal of the TWOD_YZ if-def and mprun2d namelist, the
interactive configuration procedure no longer queries for the 2-D
decompositions, and test-model contains no references to 2-D
decompositions. The validity of 2-D decompositions is checked in
spmd_dyn.F90. To impart 2-D decompositions in test-model, one needs to
set the camexp namelist accordingly. A decision needs to be made on which
decompositions are to be used, and the necessary changes must be made in
the namelist specification.

Changes to CLM land-model: None 
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

1) Added Henderson, et al's modification to call spmdinit_dyn after runtime_options,
   so that future modifications can use namelist input to decide how to decompose
   dynamics data structures.
    added: control/decompinit.F90
    modified: control/cam.F90, control/spmdinit.F90
2) Added Henderson, et al's modification to move duplicate code (ceil_2, pair)
   to a new spmd_util module.
    added: control/spmd_utils.F90
    modified: dynamics/eul - realloc4.F90, realloc7.F90, scan2.F90, spmd_dyn.F90
              dynamics/sld - realloc4.F90, realloc7.F90, scan2.F90, spmd_dyn.F90
              physics/cam1 - phys_grid.F90
3) Determined number of SMPs and process/SMP map. For EUL and SLD, equidistributed extra 
   latitudes (when mod(NLAT/npes) /= 0) over the SMPs. (This is useful when using option 1
   load balancing. See below.)
    modified: control/spmdinit.F90, dynamics/eul/spmd_dyn.F90, dynamics/sld/spmd_dyn.F90,
              dynamics/fv/spmd_dyn.F90
4) For EUL and SLD, added an option to assign latitudes to processes so that southern 
   hemisphere latitudes and their "mirrors" in the northern hemisphere are assigned 
   to consecutive processes. This is useful when using load balancing options 1 and 3 (see below).
   Currently, this is a compile time option. It will be changed to a runtime option
   in the near future. To enable now, the CPP token MIRROR_DECOMP must be added to the
   FPPFLAGS in the Makefile.
    modified: dynamics/eul - spmd_dyn.F90, bndexch.F90; dynamics/sld - spmd_dyn.F90, bndexch.F90
5) Redesigned load balancing options and implementation. The new options are
    -1: each latitude line is a single chunk, same as 1D dynamics decompositions.
        (UNCHANGED)
     0: split local longitude/latitude blocks into chunks,
        while attempting to create load-balanced chunks.
        (IMPROVED) 
     1: split SMP-local longitude/latitude blocks into chunks,
        while attempting to create load-balanced chunks.
        (NEW)
     2: load balance chunks with respect to diurnal and
        seaonsal cycles and wth respect to latitude, 
        and assign chunks to processor 
        in a way that attempts to minimize communication costs
        (UNCHANGED)
     3: load balance chunks with respect to diurnal and
        seasonal cycles (but not latitude), and assign chunks to 
        processor in a way that attempts to minimize communication 
        costs
        (NEW)

     The implementation was significantly modified. The heuristic for
     load balancing is now identical for options 0-3. The only difference
     between the options is which processes are allowed to communicate 
     when load balancing.`

     Performance comparisons on the IBM indicate that the new option 0 is an improvement
     over the old option 0. The other options (especially option 3) are now
     competitive with option 0, but are not noticeably better. These results are for T85L26
     on 128 processors of Bluesky, and different results may hold on other systems or
     for other problem sizes.

Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit) except SOM which is roundoff. There is a #define in somoce.F90
                 that if defined will make SOM bfb. If the "puny" criterion of ice_srf.F90 is
                 ever met (aice <= puny = 1.e-12) then there is a possibility that prescribed-ice 
                 mode could be good only to roundoff, but we were unable to generate such a case.
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

o Install a more permanent fix to erroneous surface fraction calculations
than the quick fix of dev50.  The original bug which dev50 addressed was that
surface fractions were being changed in an incorrect way by calls to
update_srf_fractions in coupled mode (both SOM and CCSM).  At various points
during a timestep, variable ICEFRAC contained either ice fraction of the grid
box or ice fraction of the non-land portion of the grid box.  Routine
update_srf_fractions implicity assumed it was being called to convert a
non-land fraction into a grid box fraction.  In coupled mode,
update_srf_fractions was being called by ccsmrcv every timestep after
receiving surface fraction information from the coupler.  Since ICEFRAC held
ice fraction of the grid box at this point, an erroneous calculation thus
resulted.  The dev50 quick fix was to install ifdefs around the ICEFRAC
recomputation in update_srf_fractions.  In the more permanent fix, array AICE
always represents ice fraction of the non-land portion of the grid box, and
ICEFRAC always represents the ice fraction of the entire grid box.

The updating of surface fractions and verifying their validity is now
segregated into two subroutines, comsrf.F90 routines update_ocnice and
verify_fractions, respectively.  ccsm_msg.F90 routines ccsmrcv and
ccsm_msg_getalb now call verify_fractions, instead of a routine which will
actually change the surface fractions.  If update_ocnice is ever called in
coupled mode it will result in an endrun() call.  Instead, ccsmrcv and
ccsm_msg_getalb now contain explicit code to compute new fractions
(correctly) rather than make calls to update_ocnice.  This resetting should
be unnecessary, but was retained to obtain bit-for-bit reproducibility with
earlier libraries and to avoid concerns about restartability.  We believe the
calls to update_srf_fractions were originally installed to address bizarre
restartability issues in the coupled model.  Ultimately the recomputation of
fractional information (especially landfrac every timestep) should be removed
from these routines. These spots are currently delimited with "bit-for-bit"
comments.

For further details see details on the CAM checkin list.

Changes made:

o Revised aerosol reading to be like SST and ozone, keeping in-core only 2
  time levels of data to save memory.  Initialization should speed up lots,
  since 2 time levels of aerosol data are read in instead of 12.  

  It is now feasible from a memory use standpoint to run T85 using 2 MPI
  tasks on a machine with 2 GB of memory.

  BYPASS ifdef was removed since the speedup renders it unnecessary.

  Minor mods were made to sst and ozone interpolation routines for clarity
  and consistency.

  There are still some differences between the new code and ozone/SST
  handling.  There is no "aercyc = .false." namelist option.  Date info is
  gotten from an internal Fortran "data" statement rather than read from a
  boundary dataset.  Existing routine "aerosol_initialize" takes the role of
  what otherwise would be called "aerini" (instead of being named like
  "sstini" and "oznini"), and is called from "inti" instead of "initext".
  There is a new routine "aerint" in aerosols.F90 a la "sstint" and "oznint"
  which is called from "advnce".  Like these routines it reads in a new time
  slice of data when needed.  But the actual time interpolation is done in
  "get_aerosol".  The reasons for these differences have mainly to do with
  maintaining minimal intrusiveness, and the fact that there are plans
  to modify the way time and vertical interpolation of aerosols is done.

Changes made:

After computing the ice area of the original datasets and comparing it to
the ice area produced by our t42 model, it became apparent that CAM was
over estimating the ice area. The ice fraction on the boundary dataset was
intrepreted as being the fraction of ice covering an entire gridbox.  A more
accurate way of determining the ice coverage is to regard the boundary
dataset ice fraction as the fraction of ice covering the *non-land* portion
of the grid box.  So

gridbox ice fraction = boundary dataset ice fraction * (1-land fraction)

The ice area produced by cam with this change is now very close to the
original datasets and to the ice area produced by CSM.  The overall effect
is a reduction of ice coverage in those grid boxes with some land fraction.

This change is a one line mod to comsrf.F90

Changes made:

	The cam2_0_2_dev39 commit failed (on Sep. 29, 2003). This commit reintroduces those changes.
	The following is identical to the dev39 documentation ...

        1) restructured dynamics/eul/inidat.F90 to minimize the memory requirements.
           In the original version, masterproc allocates (9+pcnst+pnats) 3D fields 
           and 16 2D fields. It then reads in or generates the initial data,
           scatters the data, and finally deallocates the arrays. In the revised
           version, subsets of arrays are allocated, initialized, scattered, and
           deallocated together, decreasing the maximum memory requirements to 4 3D fields.
           Note that I implemented the logic that Brian Eaton used in FV inidat (for WACCM)
           to treat each species in q3 separately.

        2) added a new load balancing algorithm in physics/cam1/phys_grid.F90.
           The original global balancing algorithm (opt = 1) eliminates
           imbalances due to the diurnal and seasonal cycles. However, it still
           assigns all polar latitdues to the same processors, the mid-latitudes
           to the same processors, and the equatorial latitudes to the same processors.
           The new algorithm (opt = 2) mixes up the latitudes as well, achieving
           almost perfect load balance. It comes at a cost of increased communication cost
           compared to opt = 1, and may or may not be a performance enhancer for 
           a given system, problem size, and processor count.
						        
        3) added an option to physics/cam1/phys_grid.F90 to implement the transpose_block_to_chunk
           and transpose_chunk_to_block routines using point-to-point MPI commands rather 
           than mpi_alltoallv. This has been important on some systems in the past,
           and is included here as an aid to experimentation. This option is currently
           disabled in the code.

2) The number of fields on the default monthly history files has been
   reduced substantially.  All fields continue to be available via the
   fincl namelist facility.  Also, default daily history files have
   been eliminated.  

3) The initialization of the diffusion parameters dif4 and dif2 have

Changes to CLM land-model: None (except sfc datasets must be generated).
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

o Migrated multiplication of LANDM field by cos(lat) offline.  One reason to do this was that
model-written IC files were invalid, due to erroneous multiple applications of the above-mentioned
cosine function.  Also, for horizontal resolutions other than T42 there was an  undesirable
resolution-dependent behavior of the LANDM specification algorithm.  In the new approach,
linear interpolation to the target resolution is done from a "master" LANDM dataset, which was
built at T42 (per pjr).  The resulting LANDM_COSLAT field now looks similar regardless of resolution.

The "master" LANDM_COSLAT dataset lives in /fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/atm/cam2/hrtopo/landm_coslat.nc
It is read in by offline tool "definesurf", which has been modified to read it.

Since new IC files are now required for all resolutions, it was decided to introduce consistency 
to these files by using the newest 10-minute hi-res topography dataset when creating them.  The
newest topography file is /fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/atm/cam2/hrtopo/topo10min.merged_c030506.nc
As a consequence of using this new file, existing resolution-specific surface datasets and IC 
files for CLM also are invalid.  Thus for many resolutions (though not T42), CLM must be spun
up for any runs done with cam2.0.2.dev43 and beyond.  These changes are reflected in the xml
files which are used to build CAM and CLM namelists.

o Moved calculation of tsice_rad to threaded region.  Minor speedup on IBM, potentially
more significant when OMP_NUM_THREADS is a larger number (e.g. SGI). Unfortunately this 
calculation is needed to create v2 IC files so it cannot be eliminated entirely.  But it is 
only needed when an IC file is generated, not every timestep.  So further speedup is 
possible.

o Made srfflx_state_reset callable by chunk to enable fusing threaded loops.

Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes

Changes made:

o Moved horizontal aerosol interpolation to CAM grid offline.  The main reason for
this was to speed up initialization and reduce memory usage when running CAM.  At T42 
using 2 MPI tasks, the memory hi-water mark for MPI task 0 is reduced by about 50%.  
Memory reduction for MPI task 1 is around 20%.

Since the boundary aerosol dataset is now resolution-specific, the amount of speedup vs. 
dev39 will be resolution-dependent, with lower resolutions seeing the biggest benefit.  
There will also be some speedup during the time-integration phase due to reordering loops
and array structure for cache efficiency in aerosol routine vert_interpolate.  Since 
the aerosol initialization code still reads a full 12 months of data, the startup time 
overhead and memory overheads are not insignificant.  We may want to further restructure
the code to read in aerosols the same way as SST and Ozone, keeping just 2 bounding
months of data in-core at any given time.  In the meantime, if time spent reading
the aerosol boundary data still proves to be an annoyance, things can be sped up dramatically
if the aerosol dataset is made local rather than read from an NFS-mounted file system.
Alternatively, #define BYPASS is still available from earlier libs.

The new boundary dataset generation code lives in cam/tools/interpaerosols.  A
README in that directory explains the procedure to generate an aerosol boundary
dataset at the target model resolution.  Resolution-specific aerosol datasets have
already been created for resolutions needed by test-model, and some other common
resolutions.

Mods were also made to the main CAM Makefile.  LAPACK/BLAS routines are only used by the
aerosol initialization procedure, so library references to these routines now only
exist in the offline code.


o Rewrote utility routine print_memusage for readability of output and portability.  It now
works on Linux as well as SGI and IBM.  The point of the routine is to print
memory use information at whatever point in the code the user wishes.  On most machines
the numbers printed refer to hi-water mark, but on Linux they refer to current use (i.e.
on Linux the numbers do not necessarily increase monotonically with time).  Also on
most machines, the printed numbers refer to KB of memory used.  But this is not necessarily
true on all machines (e.g. Linux).  Refer to "man getrusage" on most machines, and "man proc"
on Linux machines for details.  The output from print_memusage now goes to Fortran unit 0,
which in most cases translates to stderr.  So memory use information can be segregated from
stdout by for example: (cam < namelist >! out) >&! err.  This code is far from perfect, e.g.
printed output can still be jumbled between MPI tasks.


Misc. notes:

o To get bit for bit vs. dev39, created a 64-bit aerosol dataset, pasted lon and lat
coordinate variables from a dev39 run into the input/output file required by interpaerosols.
Under pgf90 this is bfb.  Unfortunately this procedure did not yield bfb results on IBM or SGI.

o Input aerosol dataset variable names and output history variable names are as before, but
with an "_V" appended to their name.  This reflects the fact that these variables have 
undergone a vertical sum. The different names will also cause the model to crash if an 
incorrect boundary dataset is used.

Changes made:

This update accomplishes improvements to the finite-volume transposes and to
the FV dycore itself, as undertaken by Art Mirin and Will Sawyer. Specifically:

(A) The irregular communication routines of the mod_comm library
have been placed in their own module (mod_irreg), to enable use of a unified
version of mod_comm in CAM2 and FVGCM (NASA Goddard). This facilitates making use
of ongoing improvements at Goddard (such as support for SHMEM).

(B) The transpose calls directly reference mod_irreg routines as opposed to
going through the Pilgrim layer. This is true for use of mpi derived types as
well as contiguous buffers. Pilgrim's main function is to set up communication
patterns; mod_irreg then accomplishes the transposes.

By default, the transposes gather/scatter data from/to contiguous buffers. We
have found mpi derived types to be very slightly superior on the IBM.
One can implement use of mpi derived types at compile time by activating the line
"FPPFLAGS   += -WF,-DUSE_MPI_TYPES" in the AIX section of the Makefile.
Support for one-sided (MPI2) communications when using MPI derived types has not
yet been implemented.

(C) There have been other miscellaneous improvements to Pilgrim / mod_comm.

(D) The Held-Suarez, Rayleigh friction and high-pressure mode have been removed
from the FV dycore.

(E) The FV version of inidat.F90 has been rewritten to minimize use of global 3D
arrays.

(F) Additional sectional timing diagnostics have been added, as well as an additional
optional timing barrier in the physics.

(G) There have been other miscellaneous improvements.

The following routine was added:
   cam1/models/utils/pilgrim/mod_irreg.F90

The following routines were deleted:
   cam1/models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv: hswf.F90, highp2.F90, dry_adj.F90, rayl_fric.F90

   clouds over land now goes from -20 C to 0 C.
* The land fraction ramp over the ocean goes from cos(lat) near the
   coast to 0 at 1000 km from the coast.
* The effective radius and CCN of warm clouds over land now depend
   on snow depth (linear ramp from 0 to 0.1 m liquid water equivalent).
* The evaporative efficiency for rain falling from cumulus has been
   lowered from 3.0e-6 to 2.0e-6.
* Formulae for cloud fraction associated with moist convection have
   been changed.
* Adjustments have been made to the aerosol optics.

(They are in addition to the changes described above.)
* A new energy fixer has been added.
* The parameterization of gravity wave drag has been modified.
* A new parameterization of orographic form drag has been added.
* The Hack scheme now detrains cloud liquid.
* Evaporation efficiency for stratiform rain has been halved.
* Evaporation efficiency for convective rain has been halved.
* Formulae for cloud fraction associated with moist convection have
   been changed.

The following modififications have been made to keep the standalone
CAM consistent with recent coupled runs:
* The snow fraction on land as a function of snow depth has been
   changed.
* Both visible and near-ir albedos of snow on sea ice have been
   lowered by 0.02.
* Albedos of bare sea ice have been lowered by 0.10 for visible and
   0.06 for near-ir.

There is one infrastructure change:
* ncar_batch.csh now overrides any previously set values of the environment
   variables INC_NETCDF and LIB_NETCDF to point to 64 bit versions

Changes made:
  Bunch-o-fixes II:
 - Jim Edwards' performance fix for estblf
   - wv_saturation.F90
 - change Makefile (etc.) to use 64-bit on AIX
   - Modified Makefile, run-ibm.csh, CAM_lab.pm
 - From Jim McCaa
   The code already exists in history.F90, but is CPPed out.  So, what I'm
   requesting is to remove the two CPP lines, thereby enabling the code.
   They are:
 line 2501: #if  ( defined CNTL_FORSOM )
 line 2506: #endif
   This won't affect answers, but will add fields to the monthly history
   tape.
 - From John Truesdale:
   In diagnostics.F90 the outfld call for TSICERAD needs to be removed (per
   Jerry O.)  In tphysbc.F90 the DQCOND outfld call needs to be removed
   (duplicate of outfld call using dcconnam).
 - Jim Rosinski kindly offered to add a summary message to cprnc indicating
   how many fields were compared and how many passed bfb.
   - only one file changed:
     /fs/cgd/data0/rosinski/newcprnc/cam1/models/atm/cam/tools/cprnc/cpr.F
 - Fixed bug in fv 2D decomposition (From Art Mirin)
   - Changed dp_coupling.F90 for fv
 - Fixed CAM bug #98 (originally reported by Woo Sun Yang)
   - Francis Vitt (ACD) provided the bug fix for writing staggered 'US' grid
     from history.F90.
 - Attempted to remove undocumented Lahey compiler option from Makefile as
   suggested by Jim Rosinski
 "For some reason the default CAM Makefile includes an undocumented compiler
  flag (-CcdRR8) when using lf95 on the PC.  The documented flag --dbl used
  to suffice for auto-promotion of real to real*8, and has been removed.
  Does anyone know why this was changed?  If not, I propose changing back to
  the documented flag if identical answers can be obtained.  Undocumented
  flags are a bad idea all around, I think.
  JR"
   - Can't make this change because "--dbl" promotes real*4's too (which
     will break MPI communications and history output).
   - Corrected misleading comments about this in Makefile.
 - Implemented Brian Eaton's fix for incorrect override of qmin from namelist
   - Modified all three flavors of initcom.F90
 - Removed ccm366 physics from Default*Namelist.xml.
 - Added new data file for Jerry Olson to DefaultCAMEXPNamelist.xml.

   from Tony Craig and Wei Yu.
   - Modified cd_core.F90, and ccsm_msg.F90 (physpkg.F90 already fixed)

  dev34 is bfb vs. dev33 on non-AIX machines, but
  roundoff on AIX machines.  AIX perturbation growth of cam2_0_2_dev33 is
  nearly identical to error growth of difference between cam2_0_2_dev33 and
  cam2_0_2_dev34 for all three dycores.  roundoff is entirely due to change
  in AIX compiler options to use 64-bit addressing in Makefile and in cprnc
  Makefile.  This was tested by comparing dev33+(new Makefiles) vs. dev33
  (roundoff differences observed) and comparing dev34-(new Makefiles) vs.
  dev33 (bfb exact).

cam2_0_2_dev32 contains clm2_deva_30 (with some changes on the cam branch for dust
that are only invoked when the cpp variable DUST is defined).

cam_0_2_dev33 contains clm2_deva_36 (which has incorporated the above dust mods). 

The following summarizes the changes between clm2_deva_30 and clm2_deva_36. 
The changes that lead to greater than roundoff differences are denoted by (*).

 1)  Put in dust mods in cam2_0_2_dev32.
*2*) Put in bug fix to BareGroundFluxesMod.F90 so that z0hg and z0qg at the column
     level would not be set by pft level quantities. This changes answers to more
     than roundoff.
 3)  Put in bug fix in Biogeophysics2Mod.F90 so that would not divide by
     zero when calculating the ratio of soil evaporation for a pft relative 
     to the total of all evaporating PFTs. This would occur if the weight
     became 0. in the dgvm calculation. This results in bfb answers in non-dgvm mode.
 4)  Put in bug fix to BareGroundFluxesMod.F90 so that z0hg and z0qg at the column
     level would not be set by pft level quantities. This changes answers to more
     than roundoff.
 5)  Put in bug fix in Biogeophysics2Mod.F90 so that would not divide by
     zero when calculating the ratio of soil evaporation for a pft relative 
     to the total of all evaporating PFTs. This would occur if the weight
     became 0. in the dgvm calculation. This results in bfb answers in non-dgvm mode.
 6)  Put in a change to DGVMMod.F90 to fix a bug in history file output
     in compete mode (the default now).
*7*) Reversion to old fraction snow cover algorithm (clm2_deva_32)
 8)  Made clmtype variables relating to soil hydraulic and thermal properties 
     column physical state properties rather than land physical state properties 
 9)  Fixed DGVM restart problem in compete mode:
     Modified restFileMod.F90 and DGVMMod.F90 so that average over all
     column pfts for h2ocan (needed by begwb computation in routine
     driver.F90) is done in restfileMod.F90 only for non-DGVM mode and in
     resetWeightstDGVM (in module DGVMMod.F90) for DGVM mode (since this
     needs to be done after the weights are reset in the DGVM case).
 10) Modified tssbef dimension in clmtype.F90 to be consistent.

Changes made:

The original version of oznini reads in two timelevels of ozone data
and saves them in masterproc. masterproc then interpolates the data to the
current timelevel and broadcasts the entire field to each process.
Each shortwave or longwave timestep, advnce calls oznint. 
In oznint, masterproc again interpolates the ozone data
to the current timelevel and broadcasts the entire field to each process.
(Every month or so, oznint also reads a new timelevel of 
ozone data into masterproc.)

In the new version, oznini reads in the two timelevels, then distributes
both timelevels to all of the processes, so that they can do the interpolation
on their own. Moreover, the ozone data has been chunked, and each process
holds only the data that it needs for the columns that it is responsible for.
The performance impact is a significant decrease in the number of times
masterproc sends ozone data to the other processes, and a decrease in the
amount of data sent in each remaining communication. Routines modified were
comozp.F90, oznini.F90, oznint.F90, and radozn.F90, all in control/ .

Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:

The primary goal of this update is to decrease the memory requirements
in the spectral Eulerian dycore by allocating space only for the
spectral coefficients that each processor is responsible for. While
we earlier decomposed the work, we have still been allocating the
full spectral arrays on each processor. This modification is important
for higher horizontal resolutions (T85, T170) as it decreases the memory
required for each process and may improve performance by improving memory
locality. To this end, the following files in dynamics/eul were modified:

comspe, spmd_dyn, trunc, initcom, inital, dynpkg, grcalc, hordif,
quad, and tstep

The routine spetru was also divided into 4 routines (in a new spetru module):
spetru_u., spetru_t, spetru_ps, and spetru_phis, spectrally truncating
the fields u and v, t, ps, and phis, respectively. The old spetru used
the global spectral arrays vz, d, t, and phis, which have been eliminated.
The new routines use at most a few single level global spectral arrays to
truncate the fields, again decreasing the required memory.

Finally a few random changes were included in this update:

Makefile - 
   Added -lcxml to the LDFLAGS for OSF, to link in DGETRF and DGETRS
   on the Pittsburgh AlphaServer SC (needed by aerosols.F90)

caerbnd.F90, dmsbnd.F90: 
   Moved declaration for ncol so that it appears before its use in 
   array declarations. (HP/Compaq compiler complained.)

physpkg.F90:
   Removed redundant USE of time_manager variables. (HP/Compaq compiler 
   complained.)

carbon_intr.F90, seasalt_intr.F90
   Removed redundant USE of shr_const_mod variables. (HP/Compaq compiler
   complained.)

Changes made:

o Backed out the Fortran 90 interface from sulfur codes per CRB.
o IMPORTANT NOTE: There is a reproducibility problem on the IBM when the sulfur routines are
  enabled.  This problems exists both in the previous library (2.0.2.dev27) and this commit.
  Only the sulfur fields are affected, and the impact appears to be minor.  The problem is 
  likely related to threading, since 1-day test runs on IBM machines with OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
  give reproducible answers.  Threaded tests on chinook (SGI) were successful.  Note that
  test-model does not enable the sulfur routines, so results were bit-for-bit.

Changes to CLM land-model: Hacks for dust, see "#if (defined DUST)"
Have you filled out the pre-check-in documentation as required by the CAM CRB?  yes
Changes made:
Updated Natalie Mahowald's dust package (including her land model changes) to 
work with PCOLS=16.  It does not crash on anchorage but does crash on 
blakcforest when cpp token DUST is defined (by default, dust, sulfates, 
sea salt, and carbon packages are turned off via cpp tokens).  MORE WORK NEEDS 
TO BE DONE.  

This tag is identical to cam2_0_2_dev25_brnchT_paero7.  

Note that pgf90-pgcc and pgf90-gcc are known to fail because the Makefile has 
not been updated to deal with the new F90 netcdf interfaces used in the new 
code.  The next tag should replace the F90 interfaces with the standard CAM 
wrap_ncf() calls, if possible.

Changes made:
Added prognostic aerosols.  All four packages (sulfates, carbon, sea salt, and 
dust) are independently #ifdef'd out in aerosol_intr.F90.  Sulfates have 
been tested with the other three off.  Results are bfb with cam2_0_2_dev25 
when all four are off.  Feedback to radiation is disabled in radctl.F90 (see 
commented-out calls to set_aerosol_from_prognostics).  

Time constraints forced the choice of cpp and comments instead of namelist 
variables...

models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam1/tphysac.F90
models/atm/cam/src/physics/cam1/vertical_diffusion.F90

Introduced orographic form drag in vertical_diffusion module.
Modified gravity wave drag in gw_drag module.
These changes necessitated changes to the interfaces in tphysac.

Form drag and the new gravity wave drag algorithm are implemented only 
when using the finite volume dycore.  However, for the spectral dycores
the gravity wave algorithm was changed to disallow the formation of 
gravity waves over pure ocean points with non-zero orographic standard
deviation.

Changes made:

Add dycore independent energy fixer.  Currently it is only applying an energy fix when run
with the FV dycore.  For the spectral dycores it is diagnostic.

A round-off level change was introduced into the spectral dycores due to 2 changes:
1. The definition of dry static energy was changed to include the surface geopotential.
2. The conversion between dry and wet constituent mixing ratios was moved into the coupling layer,
   and an extraneous conversion that previously happened at the end of tphysbc and at the beginning
   of tphysac has been removed.

Clean more files in the $MODEL_BLDDIR when using test-model.pl or run-model.pl
(fixes bug #112)

Send all *.cprout files to $MODEL_EXEDIR instead of $SCRIPT_DIR this prevents
overwrites of files by different machines. This is a partial fix to bug #118.

Changes made:

o Speedup mods.  Should see order 10% speedup on SGI, 3% on IBM.  Even better than that for
  more than 32 threads on SGI.  Specifics were:
  - fuse threaded loops to minimize threading overhead
  - Don't dereference pointers in expensive history calculations.
  - Thread some calculations called from physpkg that were previously single-threaded.  This
    likely is the reason for such a big speedup on SGI.

o Changed ifdef DEBUG to HDEBUG inside history.F90.  Reason was model barfed somewhere in
  physics when DEBUG ifdef was set.

o Fix max/min combined with flag_xyfill=.true. pathological history case (prv commit).

Code reviewed by: myself
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes made:

o Added ISCCP cloud simulator.  Cost overhead is around 5%.  You need to set 
  namelist variable doisccp = .true. to enable the simulator.  Then
  isccpdata  = '/fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/atm/cam2/rad/isccp.tautab_invtau.nc'
  to tell the simulator where the required boundary dataset is.

  Had to set default doisccp = .false. because test-model will barf when cprnc
  gets confused at the different values of the "levels" coordinate variable.
  This needs to be fixed.

  Output from the simulator is 6 fields.  The key field is FISCCP1, dimensioned
  lon x 49 x lat x time.  The 49 is really 7 pressure levels by 7 optical 
  depths.  Pressure and optical depth of each "level" can be determined from
  dimension variable "isccp_prstau".  Pressure is the number to the left of
  the decimal point in mb.  Optical depth is the number to the right of the
  decimal point times 1000.

  The simulator is only called during daytime (coszrs > 0).  As a consequence,
  routine outfld in history.F90 was modified to ignore input array locations
  set to fillvalue.  To enable this feature, a new argument to addfld named
  flag_xyfill was added.  Set it to .true. to enable outfld ignoring fillvalue
  input.  Currently this is only done for appropriate ISCCP fields.  If this
  feature is enabled, for multilevel fields the setting of fillvalue MUST be
  invariant in the z-direction.  The reason is that the accumulator (nacs) is
  currently only dimensioned x-y.  The history handler checks for this 
  consistency and barfs if it is not met.  Changing the accumulator to be
  x-y-z capable would not be too hard, but might have severe performance
  ramifications.

        - Removed artificial repartitioning of snow and rain in fields
          sent to coupler to be ready for CLM2.2.
        - Fixed bug in read/write of precca, precla, precsca, precsla
          (Mariana Vertenstein, Bryon Boville)
        - Modified coupling for LR dycore, removed special mods for LR
          dycore in sendgrid setting mask to zero at most pole latitudes.
          This was required for CCSM coupled runs with the LR dycore.

      spmdinit.F90
        - Removed the MPI_INIT call for COUP_CSM mode, cpl6 now handles this.
        - Removed use of shr_msg_comm_atm (cpl5).  Added a call to 
          cpl_interface_init (cpl6) to return the MPI communicator group.

      cam.F90
        - Modified some code on COUP_CSM definitions, remove calls to 
          shr_msg_init, shr_msg_groups, and shr_msg_finalize (cpl5).

Changes to CLM land-model: None (one-line description)
Changes made:

I've added code and a set of namelist variables that allow fields for 
a particular history tape to be written on a column by column basis.  
The new namelist variables are named fincl1lonlat ... fincl6lonlat and 
are used in conjunction with the fincl1 ... fincl6 namelist variables.

Here is an example of how to use the new variables to define individual
columns or a lat/lon range of columns for output.

1. Define a history tape with a set of fields that you would like to see
   output at specific columns

    ex. fincl3 = 'LHFLX','SHFLX','PS','T','U'

2. Define the columns for that history tape using  fincl[1..6]lonlat
   Like the fincl[1..6] specifiers all of the column identifiers are strings.
   Specify the longitude in degrees followed by a single character
   (e)ast/(w)est modifier. Follow this with an underscore ('_') and then
   specify the latitude in degrees followed by a single character
   (n)orth/(s)outh modifier.

    ex. fincl3lonlat = '30.5e_45.5n'

        will output the model column closest to 30.5 degrees east longitude
        and 45.5 degrees north latitude for all fields defined by history tape
        3.

    You can specify a range of longitudes (or latitudes) by separating
    the min and max values with a colon (':') like so

    ex. fincl3lonlat = '30e:40e_45n'

        will output the closest model columns from 30 to 40 degrees east
        and at 45 degrees north for all fields defined on history tape 3.

    The latitudes/longitudes must be positive (real or integer).

        longitude values range from [0w to 180w] and [0e to 180e]
        latitude values range from [90s to 0s] and [0n to 90n]

3) Variables will be put on the history tape with the longitude and latitude
   coded as part of the name.

    Ex. Using these namelist variables

        fincl3 = 'LHFLX','SHFLX','PS','T','U'
        fincl3lonlat = '30.5e_45.5n','30e:40e_45n'

        will produce the following fields on history tape 3.

          LHFLX_30.5e_45.5n
          LHFLX_30e_to_40e_45n
          PS_30.5e_45.5n
          PS_30e_to_40e_45n
          SHFLX_30.5e_45.5n
          SHFLX_30e_to_40e_45n
          T_30.5e_45.5n
          T_30e_to_40e_45n
          U_30.5e_45.5n
          U_30e_to_40e_45n

   The netcdf attributes for each field will be set to include the
   actual latitude and longitude.  This allows tools like ferret
   to correctly plot the correct part of the world grid.

Code reviewed by: myself, Will Sawyer
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
(Note: test-model.pl only does checks this -- if you run it with the "-compare" option)
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes made:

        The main changes are in the area of transposes for the 2D FV decomposition.

        a. Transposes now include ghost points, which obviates extra ghost point
                communication following the transposes. This improves performance,
                but with limited impact because so few of the transposes involve ghost
                points.

        b. Transposes now use the NASA/Goddard mod_comm package, which lies underneath
                Pilgrim. This enables use of one-sided MPI-2 communications as well as
                standard MPI. NASA/Goddard personnel report substantial gains on
                the SGI when MPI-2 is used in place of standard MPI.

        c. Arrays containing extra points in any of the dimensions still cannot
                be handled and must be copied into (out of) arrays without extra
                points. Instead, the associated copies are, to the extent possible,
                overlapped with other messages. This improves performance.

        d. The number of tracers to be transposed simultaneously is now specifiable.
                Formerly, all tracers had to be transposed together. This facilitates
                overlapping copying with communication (see above point). If there are
                N tracers altogether, to be transposed in groups of M, one solves
                N = Q * M + R, and does Q groups of M and 1 group of R. Preliminary
                tests indicate that M=1 is good for coarse domain decompositions,
                but that as the decomposition becomes finer, the latency of multiple
                transpose calls outweighs the computation/communicaiton overlap
                benefit. The default is M=6.

        e. A new method for initializing the transposes has been implemented.
                Unlike the old methodology, this new method works for ghost points.
                The method scales fine spatially but very poorly with the number of
                tracers to be simultaneously transposed. Until this is fixed,
                one would best limit M (see above point) to 6 (the default).

        f. We have been experimenting with MPI derived types, versus the current
                method of copying data in and out of contiguous buffers. At present
                we are getting mixed results. This option has been implemented for
                MPI-1 only (not MPI-2). Further testing is underway.

        The files affected are:
                Directory ...../src/dynamics/fv, files cd_core.F90, dp_coupling.F90,
                        dynamics_vars.F90, dynpkg.F90, geopk.F90, inidat.F90,
                        p_d_adjust.F90, pmgrid.F90, spmd_dyn.F90, stepon.F90, trac2d.F90.                              These are virtually all transpose-related changes.

                Directory ...../src/control, files cam.F90, spmdinit.F90.
                        The change to cam.F90 is to make sure TWOD_YZ is not set when SPMD
                        is unset. The change to spmdinit.F90 has to do with MPI
                        initialization on SGI machines when using MPI-2.

                Directory ...../utils/pilgrim, files Makefile, Makefile.conf.AIX,
                        Makefile.conf.IRIX64, decompmodule.F90, ghostmodule.F90, memstuff.c,
                        mod_comm.F90, parutilitiesmodule.F90, puminterfaces.F90,
                        redistributemodule.F90.

                Directory ...../utils/pilgrim/unit_testers, files Makefile,
                        decomptest.F90, ghosttest.F90, parpatterntest.F90,
                        parutilitiestest.F90, redistributetest.F90, unstructured.F90.

                Directory ...../bld, files Makefile, configure_fv.pl, script.m4.
                        The change to Makefile is to provide option for 64-bit addressing
                        on IBM. To do so, switch actual and commented lines to set
                        ADDRESS    := Q64. The other two files are NASA/Goddard-specific.

                Directory ...../test/system, file llnl_frost.csh.

        A full diff of changes is on goldhill in ~mirin/diffs/diff_archive_cam2_0_2_dev10.

        Here is some information on new, as well as existing knobs:

        Two parameters have been added to the mprun2d namelist (used for 2D FV
                decomposition) - geopktrans and tracertrans. Geopktrans refers to the
                geopotential computation/communication method in geopk.F90. A value
                of 0 (default), which results in the setting of geopk16byte false,
                means that transposes are computed before and after the calls to
                geopk (from cd_core) in order to do the vertical indefinite integrals
                in geopk. A value of 1 causes geopk16byte to be set to true,
                meaning that instead of computing transposes, partial sums in each
                vertical subdomain are calculated and then communicated in z as
                needed; 16-byte arithmetic may be used to guarantee bit-for-bit agreement
                across domain decomposition; the default (for purposes of speed) is
                8-byte arithmethic. One can change to 16-byte arithmetic by editing
                geopk.F90 to change DSIZE from 8 to 16 (switch actual and commented
                statements). For performance purposes, the code should be used
                as is with geopktrans equal to 1. The other parameter, tracertrans,
                refers to the number of tracers simultaneously transposed (denoted by
                M above); the default is 6 and in general need not be changed.

        One can implement MPI derived types in the transposes by activating
                USE_MPI_TYPES in models/utils/pilgrim/parutilitiesmodule.F90.
                This is unsupported - do so at your own risk. This bypasses mod_comm
                and works for only MPI-1. One can make use of MPI-2 in mod_comm by
                activating MPI2 at the beginniing of mod_comm.F90. Use of this is
                definitely at your own risk.

        To run waccm configuration tests, please see instructions on goldhill
                in ~mirin/waccm.

if a simulation aborts test-model.pl won't stop. Fix reporting
problem of different history files with -nofail. Improve the
diagnostic output of test-model.pl especially for the -nofail
case. Also be more careful at cleaning up data, such that data files
are deleted only after needed comparisions are done.

New datasets are available under "datasets" on the cam developers
web page.

Changed these ESMF files to allow for removal of lots and lots of other
ESMF files:

Update to ESMF_0_0_2p8, so can prune out unused files and directories.
Also turn off dependency of OMP, PCL, and MPI libraries. This simplifies,
shortens, and makes the ESMF make more robust. It also removes half of the
amount of disk storage for ESMF than was used before, several of the unused
code directories were removed and only the minimal set needed for using
the ESMF time manager.

in Filepath, and add #define COUP_SOM in misc.h.

For prescribed-ice control runs that will create fluxes for SOM, to get
good results CNTL_FORSOM must also be #defined.

Climates have only been examined in EUL mode. SLD and FV do compile, but they
have not yet been tested.

Changes made:
These mods were to fix a bug with the newly added surface diagnostics.
They were not giving bit for bit when restarting fv and sld runs.  To
fix this I had to add some variables to the restart dataset
as well as put a n-1 timelevel of landfrac,ocnfrac,and icefrac into the
physics buffer.  These n-1 timelevel values are used from the physics
buffer on restart.

cam-bugs Requests resolved: 92, 88
(See http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cgi-bin/wreq/req?list-5)
Requires change in build system: no
Lots of accumulated minor fixes for SGI, Linux, IBM.  All bfb.  Biggest change 
is support for Linux-Lahey in source code and ncar_batch.csh.  Brian Eaton, 
Pat Worley, John Truesdale, Jim Rosinski, and Erik Kluzek contributed various 
bits.  
Substantial timing or memory changes: no

fixes for test-model.pl)
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: None (one-line description)
Changes made:
Note:  This is item #018 on CAM Check-in List "Fix performance bug in Makefile 
       for SGI (formerly CAM task list #02.12.19.5)".  It's scope has expanded 
       a bit.  
A- Modified Makefile for SGI so LDFLAGS has options and libraries in the 
   correct order ( -mp -lmp -lmpi ) as described by Pat Worley.
B- Added Brian Eaton's fix for run-ibm.csh:
   "On the IBM there are 3 environment variables that allow you to specify the
    node/task configuration.  The 2 that are set in the run-ibm.csh file imply
    that the total number of mpi tasks (procs) is 2.  It's likely that your job
    has procs=1 due to the 3rd environment variable, MP_PROCS, being set
    somewhere else, like your .cshrc or .profile file (perhaps by the SCD
    supplied default version of these files).  The fix I'd suggest is to add
    the command "unsetenv MP_PROCS" to run-ibm.csh file in the POE Environment
    settings section."  -- Brian Eaton
C- Added Brian Eaton's fix for run-ibm.csh to ncar_batch.csh too.
D- Added support for the Lahey compiler on anchorage to ncar_batch.csh.  PGI
   becomes an option, Lahey the default.
E- Added John Truesdale's fixes for ice_srf.F90, comsrfdiag.F90, and
   fv_prints.F90.  This allows versions cam2_0_2_dev1 and later to work
   with the Lahey compiler.  Prior to these fixes, lf95 was complaining about
   unintialized variables (etc.).
F- Erik Kluzek fixed test-model.pl to work around a problem on bluesky.
G- Changed pgf90 optimization from -fast to -O1 in Makefile to fix bfb problem
   with test-model.pl test #fv06 (compare initial run to restart run with
   different number of processors for fv dycore).  All other tests were 
   passing bfb with -fast.

Changes to CLM land-model: changed division by parameter to division by local copy in lnd_grid, to eliminate compiler complaint
Changes made:

Implemented a consistent wavenumber decomposition for Fourier
and Spectral domains in SLD dycore, decreasing MPI communication and
storage requirements. Wavenumber decomposition also modified, 
to improve load balance and decrease amount of communication.
This modification is similar to that in cam2_0_1_dev3, except for
SLD instead of EUL.

Routines modified in dynamics/sld: comspe, courlim, dyn, dyndrv,
dynpkg, grcalc, hordif, quad, realloc4, realloc7, scan2, scandyn, 
scanslt, spegrd, spmd_dyn, trunc, tstep, tstep1, vertnm.
Routines deleted in dynamics/sld: realloc3, realloc6 .

Also, changed division by parameter to division by a local
copy of the parameter in two places in lnd_grid, to eliminate
a compilation failure with some versions of the IBM compiler.
(Fix provided by Art Mirin.)

Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes made:

Add ability to specify additional flags to the C compiler and to the loader
(this ability already exists for the Fortran compiler).  This provides
flexibility in porting to new platforms.

Change Makefile so that the Filepath, Srcfiles, and Depends files are
explicitly in the current directory.  This fixes a bug which occurs when
make finds a Srcfiles file in the VPATH, and that Srcfiles is newer than
the Filepath (which results in Srcfiles not being created in the current
directory and the command to build the Depends file fails).

Add an option to configure to allow the configuration cache file to be
created in a different directory than the CAM build directory.  The default
behavior of configure is unchanged.

Fix a broken configuration.  The combination of omp on linux using pgf90
and gcc resulted in the timing library being built without threading
enabled.  Removed the setting of the THREADED_PTHREADS and THREADED_OMP cpp
macros from utils/timing/gpt.h and set these in the Makefile.  This also
allows them to be set only when SMP is true.  They were previously set to
use threads whether the rest of the model was threaded or not.

The new ncar_batch.csh can be used to do bitwise comparison with a previous

option.  

For NQS or PBS, the new usage is: 
>> env SCRIPT_DIR=`pwd` COMPARE_DIR=$MYBASEDIR qsub ncar_batch.csh

For LoadLeveler, the new usage is:  
env SCRIPT_DIR=`pwd` COMPARE_DIR=$MYBASEDIR llsubmit ncar_batch.csh

In both cases, directory $MYBASEDIR should contain the source code for the 
previous version.

Changes made:

Added diagnostics to allow for surface energy budget calculations.  The
following diagnostics were added:

FSNSLND,FSNSOCN,FSNSICE,FLNSLND,FLNSOCN,FLNSICE,SHFLXLND,SHFLXOCN,SHFLXICE,
LHFLXLND,LHFLXOCN,LHFLXICE.

Also added the following diagnostics to provide ocean/ice forcing for som
model

FSNSOI,FLNSOI,SHFLXOI,LHFLXOI

Moved the interpolation of ocean and ice right before the surface routines
that use them.  SSTINT and ICEINT were previously at the top of the time
loop before tphysbc in the routine advnce.  I removed them from advnce and
placed them after tphysbc right before camocn and camice.  This corrected
a minor bug in the models use of fluxes calculated by camocn and camice.
Previously new fluxes were computed by camocn and camice with a set of 
land, ocean, and ice fractions.  The time loop ended, advnce was called,
new surface fractions computed and then tphysbc used the fluxes calculated
the previously time around only using the new fractions instead of the
surface fractions used to compute the fluxes.  tphysbc now uses the time
level of fractions appropriate for the fluxes that are being read in.

Changes made:
	
1) clm2.1 has replaced clm2.0 in the current code.
   updated models/lnd/clm to clm development tag clm2_deva_07 
   The differences are roundoff.
   Two climate simulations were done to verify this commit.
   case: /OLESON/csm/eul_201dev10    - cam2_0_1_dev10 (clm2.0)
   case: /OLESON/csm/eul_201dev10_06 - cam2_0_1_dev10 (clm2.1 - tag clm2_deva_06) 
   The two cases were been compared with the standard climatological SST simulation 
   using CAM2.0.dev24 (case eul20dev24_a) and show the same climate  
   Performance on blackforest is effectively the same.
	
2) initial clm datasets used with clm2.0 are no longer compatible with clm2.1
   surface datasets used with clm2.0 will work with clm2.1
   restart files used with clm2.0 are not compatible with clm2.1
   a conversion tool has been created (see directory models/lnd/clm2/tools/convert_inic)
   running gmake in this directory will generate the conversion tool executable, convert_inic
   datasets needed by configure have already been converted and have been placed in the 
   directory /fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/lnd/clm2/inidata_2.1/cam
	
3) the xml file DefaultCLMEXPNamelist.xml in models/atm/cam/bld has been modified 
   to point to the converted clm2.1 initial datasets

Version: CAM2.0_1.dev12
One-line Summary: new physics buffer and misc makefile changes
cam-bugs Requests resolved: none
Requires change in build system: yes
ccm366 physics now requires pnats=0 (done by configure)
Substantial timing or memory changes: no
Requires change in run script: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no

Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes

Code reviewed by: myself
Restart files change: yes, one fewer timelevel saved for cld, tcwat, qcwat, 
and lcwat fields.
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes made:

Implement new physics buffer (phys_buffer.F90) to manage fields that
persist across timesteps or that are communicated between different physics
packages within a time step.  Eventually the buffer.F90 module will be
replaced.  For now only the fields used by the stratiform cloud condensate
scheme are being managed by the physics buffer.  

The new module in cldcond.F90 is the start of an implementation of the new
physics interface for the cloud condensate parameterization.  It currently
just deals with the fields that use the physics buffer.  These fields save
a dycore dependent number of timelevels in the buffer, and that number has
been reduced by one from the buffer.F90 implementation (i.e., eul saves 2
old timelevels while fv and sld just save one).

Removed the need to declare pnats=1 for a cloud water constituent which
wasn't used when running with ccm366 physics.  The configure script now
sets pnats=0 in that case.

Modify Makefile, configure, and config_cache_defaults.xml to support using
netCDF f90 interface.  The environment variable MOD_NETCDF should be set to 
the directory that contains the netCDF module files.  This capability is not yet
required as CAM isn't currently using the netCDF Fortran 90 interface.

Added -qmaxmem=-1 to the AIX fflags for optimization.

Tested in adiabatic mode: yes
Code reviewed by: myself
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no, except for a specific non-production configuration described below
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes made:

Implemented mods to allow specifying for each constituent whether the
initial values are to be read from the initial file or set by an
initialization routine.  The namelist variable readtrace now serves to set
the default value for all constituents except water vapor (its default
value is .true.).  The default may be overridden by an optional argument in
the calls that register the constituents.  The optional argument may be set
by namelist variables that are managed by the constituent's package, or may
be hardwired in the call.  The ghg chemistry package uses the default value
determined by readtrace.  The test_tracers package hardwires the initial
values to be set by an initialization routine.  Thus it is no longer
necessary to set readtrace=.false. to run the test_tracer package in CAM.
The namelist variables nusr_adv and nusr_nad have been disabled.

In the FV dycore only, the initialization of constituents has been modified
to initialize one constituent at a time.  This is to reduce the memory
requirements since we couldn't fit the waccm configuration (2x2.5, 66
levels, 50 constituents) on the ibm-winterhawk2 nodes.

The mods do not change answers in the production model.  However the
following configuration has non-bfb changes: When the ghg chemistry is run
using initial values that are set by its initialization routine (rather
than being read from the initial file), the answers change due to changed
initial values.  The ghg initial values are set with uniform distributions
rather than having a decay in the stratosphere as was previously done.
Byron believes this distribution will spin up to an equilibrium state more
quickly than the previous initial distribution.

Changes to CLM land-model: New land model decomposition on clumps and alltoall comunication for CAM+CLM configuration
Changes made:

1. Added new subroutine get_chunk_coord_owner_p() to phys_grid for
   both cam1 and ccm366 versions.

2. Added lnd_grid module containing the following:

   public surface_grid_init          ! initializes land surface decomposition
   public get_nclumps                ! returns the number of clumps defined
   public get_clump_cell_id_coord    ! returns clump/cell ids based on lon/lat
   public get_clump_owner_id         ! returns clump owner based on clump id
   public get_clump_ncells_proc      ! returns number of cells for process
   public get_clump_ncells_id        ! returns number of cells in clump
   public get_clump_tpatch_proc      ! returns number of patches for process
   public get_clump_tpatch_id        ! returns number of patches in clump
   public get_clump_coord_id         ! returns lon/lat coordinates based on id
   public get_clump_patchinfo        ! returns patch id and number of patches
   public get_clump_patchwt          ! returns patch weight based on patch num

   surfage_grid_init() performs the land model domain decomposition into
   clumps of grid cells containing patches.  Clumps are private derived
   data types which may be accessed through a suite of functions and
   subroutines also contained in lnd_grid (see above).

3. Added lp_coupling module containing the following:

   public lp_coupling_init             ! initialize clump<-->chunk mapping
   public lp_coupling_finalize         ! destroy clump<-->chunk mapping
   public alltoall_clump_to_chunk_init ! communicate fluxes from lnd to atm
   public alltoall_clump_to_chunk      ! communicate fluxes from lnd to atm
   public alltoall_chunk_to_clump      ! communicate fluxes from atm to lnd

   lp_coupling_init() initializes the mapping between atmosphere
   physics chunks and land model clumps.  It also allocates buffers
   for use by subroutines within the module which perform the alltoallv
   communication/transposition of surface state and fluxes between the
   atmosphere and the land.  This coupling is used when CAM and CLM are
   run together as a single executable (when COUP_CAM is defined).

4. Removed lnd_atmMod module which previously did processor mapping
   for coupling.

5. Modified atm_lndMod module to use routines from lp_coupling for coupling.
   Added TIMING_BARRIERS barriers for communications timing tests.

6. Modified clm_map subroutine to call surface_grid_init() (lnd_grid) for
   domain decomposition and lp_coupling_init() (lp_coupling) to initialize
   the atm<->lnd coupling.

7. Added npes=1 definition even for the case when SPMD is undefined so
   that new domain decomposition works correctly when running SMP-only.

    2) Modified grcalc to set dalpn(2) to zero on processors
       that do not calculate it. This eliminates a failure in
       the SGI test-model DEBUG tests from using an uninitialized 
       variable. (dalpn(2) is used to calculate zurcor, which is
       used only on the processor which also calculates dalpn(2). )
    3) Moved an array initialization using array syntax
       out of an OpenMP loop, as a 
       work around for a pgf90 compiler error.

Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes made:

This set of mods is in preparation for further mods to implement the new
physics interface design for initializing constituents.  The current loop
to initialize constituents that are not read from the initial file (in
{eul,fv,sld}/inidat.F90) contains a call to ramp_ghg().  This function sets
surface values for the ghg constituents which are used by the radiation
codes as well as by the ghg chemistry code.  The mods being committed
gather the code which is responsible for setting surface values of the ghg
constituents, and time interpolating them (ramping) from an annual dataset
if requested, into the single module in the file ghg_surfvals.F90.

The new module ghg_surfvals does the following:
. maintains the values co2vmr, co2mmr, n2ovmr, ch4vmr, f11vmr, and f12vmr
  as public data
. maintains the namelist variables scenario_ghg and rampyear_ghg.  The
  meaning of these variables has not changed.
. provides ramping functionality (time interpolation) when scenario_ghg is
  set to 'RAMPED'.  The data used by the ramp is determined by an include
  statement in the module.  Either file ramp_ghg_bau.h or ramp_ghg_stab.h
  may be included.  These .h files contain data formated as module data.
  When using ramped data the default is to interpolate to the current
  time.  This may be modified by setting the rampyear_ghg variable to a
  valid year which is then used to produce values that will cycle within
  that fixed year.

Changes made:

  Eliminated tmpr and tmpi in grcalcs and grcalca in dynamics/eul/grcalc.F90:

    tmpr = alps(ir)*alp(mr+n,irow)
    tmpi = alps(ii)*alp(mr+n,irow)

  in-lining the expressions in the two places where each
  of them is used.This causes roundoff level changes to the solution
  on the IBM, but not on the HP/Compaq. With this change, the restructuring
  of the domain decomposition used in the spectral Eulerian (next check-in)
  will be bit-for-bit. This check-in is used to isolate and document
  the source of the roundoff change.

Changes to CLM land-model: update to clm2_3_dev32
Changes made:

Build changes:

	Fix bug in "configure -test", so that tests will be done
in cam_bld directory, and then return to pwd. Add ability to do
T85, and T170 resolutions. Change prun in CAM_lab.pm for running
in hybrid mode.

History restart fix:

	History restart files weren't going to mass store -- now
they do.

Decomposition set in phys_grid_init rather than in call to it:

	Previously there were four locations to determine the
chunking decomposition type.

	Also remove the "is_lsm" and "is_phys366" methods. Always
assume that lsm will ONLY be run with phys366 and CLM will ONLY be
run with the new physics.

Update CLM to CLM2_3_dev32

	This fixes a problem with getting clmi files at T170.

Fix deadlock problem with scenario_so4:

	A parameter was only set on masterproc that needed to be
set on all nodes.

Update to ccsm2_0_beta53 and scripts_a020822

	both scripts and models/bld directories. scripts_a020822 fixes
a minor problem in ccsm2_0_beta53 scripts.

Test scripts:

	Add test-example.pl script to run the examples from the
users guide. Does limited checking to ensure things work as expected.
This is setup to run on blackforest.

	Add ability to set the remote lab in the "-errgro" option
in test-model.pl. This allows for port validation for remote
machines. Also delete more files that test-model.pl produces when
running in the default "clean" configuration. This prevents having
lots of wasted disk space for test-model.pl tests.

Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes made:

FV 2D parallel decomposition option added to bld scripts:

	Requires a new namelist (mprun2d).
	Also added a "-fv2d" option to test-model.pl to run fv tests
	with 2D decompostion. Also fix the constraint in src/dynamics/fv
	so that the npr_yz array from the namelist is checked properly.

Solaris:
	Change Makefile so that model gives climate similar to IBM.

Makefile:
	Add CPPDEF for CPP definitions used by all platforms. Also
	include a new token "CAM" declared when compling code with CAM.
	Remove "-d" on AIX, and turn on "-g, -qfullpath" in 
	production mode so that when the model core-dumps you can 
	query the core files to find where it died.

dif4:
	Now require dif4 to be set on namelist for Eulerian dynamics not
	at T42 resolution.

restart-pointer files:
	Get rid of getfil for restart-pointer file and add an optional
	argument to opnfil, so that "old" can be given for type so that
	the model will die if a restart pointer file doesn't exist.

Fix some problems with using scenario_so4:
	Fix write statements before "call endrun" so that they will be
	written even if not on masterproc. Also broadcast sulfdata to all
	nodes. There still seems to be other problems with this configuration.

namelist:
	Fix namelist parsing so that repeat declarations can be used
	(i.e. mfilt = 4*1). Also update the change method so that it parses
	as a regular namelist which allows arrays to be entered and more
	complex namelist entries.
test/system:
	Add ccm366 test and SMP=FALSE test to test-model.pl (unless on 
	AIX, ensure that SMP test gives same answers as SPMD). Add "-fv2d"
	option to test-model.pl to check FV 2D decompostion. Add some simple
	performance checking to test-model.pl. Add test-production.pl
	a script to run the production model from Sep to Feb/1 weekly
	to ensure the model is running as expected.

check-timing.pl:
	Add a script to do straight forward parsing of timing.* files to
	look at performance. Simplist operation is as follows:

	check-timing.pl directory1 directory2

	Options also exist to load the log-files in, and casenames, as
	well as a list of timers to parse in the file. To get help invoke
	it with "-help" or without any arguments.

ESMF: 	Update to ESMF_0_0_2p5 (fixes problem with compiling on Sanitas)
	This small update changes the name of "conf.h" to ESMF_conf.h
	so that it won't find the wrong file in the search path. It also
	removes the hard-wired use of /usr/local/include. Also previous 
	model versions didn't have all files updated to ESMF_0_0_2p4, and
	this update fixes that problem.

FV now passes LF95 strict checking tests with test-model.pl:

	Arrays in restart_physics:write_restart were going over pcols
	rather than cols for FV. By having the arrays only go to ncols
	this worked with LF95 and FV.

phys_grid.F90:
	Change a difficult to understand OMP loop used to get the
	number of threads to a more straight-forward OMP subroutine call.
CCSM:
	Update to ccsm2_0_beta50. Add table for dif4 to atm.setup.csh.

Changes to CLM land-model: Fix restart pointer files for long casenames
Changes made:

SLD changes for Lahey strict error checking:

	Small changes to q arrays sent to a few routines so that
	dimension of arrays would pass strict error checking in Lahey
	compiler.

Restarts:

	Change restarts when running coupled (COUP_CSM on), so that
	data not used for coupled runs not output/read. This also allows
	model to use the restart files from the b20.007 simulation.

Sort routines:

	Change sort routines in responce to bug found by Phil Rasch.

csm_share:

	Update csm_share to share2.1.3.

Misc:

	#include "" to #include <>
	Initialize ctitle and let it be up to 256 characters.
	Put "if (masterproc)" around write(6 statements for ramping.
	test-model.pl, get rid of global data used for setting up tests.
		Replace it with methods. This is a better more robust solution.
	Add -qfullpath when debug on for IBM.
	Update models/bld, and scripts directories to ccsm2_0_beta47.
	Get coupled scripts to work with CAM directory structure, and
		change so that restart can work.

CLM:
	Don't limit length on string read in from restart pointer file, 
	as this causes problem when casenames are long.

Solaris:

	Change Makefile so that model will work, get rid of special
	F77 compilation and use new autopromotion flag in the new compiler.

T31:

test-model.pl

	Fix a couple problems with test-model.pl. Will now properly
run through the list of all dynamics. Start refactoring to a more
general way to run through the tests with object methods rather than
global data. Put quotes around run env variables, allow setting of
interactive option in CAM_namelist, make sure CAM objects have everything 
properly set withe either setenv or setcfg.

Lahey fix:

	A few changes to dynamics/eul so that qfcst arrays can be properly
dimensioned. Inside spegrd and tfilt_massfix copy qfcst from i1 to nlon+i1-1,
so that strange things with memory don't have to be done. This allows
tests 1 and 2 with test-model.pl to work for Eulerian dynamics. Test 13 fails.

icefrac bug-fix:
	Fix problem introduced in cam1_8_dev10 on initialization of
	icefrac. 

Build fixes:
	Various fixes to build scripts to work on machines at ORNL.

Name changes:

	Dataset names change to be consistent with the following format:

	<model><file type>_YYYY-MM-DD_<resolution>_L<vertical levels>_<description>_<creation date>.nc

	resolution for spectral dycores is refered to as nlatxnlon, with
	the spectral truncation following. So for example, Eulerian T42 is
	refered to as: 64x128_T42, SLD T63 is 64x128_T63. Datasets that
	don't have a specific spectral truncation associated with them
	leave off the spectral truncation part (so initial datasets run
	through definesurf or most land datasets).

	Example:

	cami_0000-09-01_64x128_L26_c020514.nc

test-model.pl

	Fix test-model.pl so that release version of the model could be

Requires change in build system: no
Substantial timing or memory changes: no
Requires change in run script: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: yes
Machines tested: IBM, SGI, Linux-PGI, Linux-PGI/GCC
	Some testing with Solaris and Compaq, but not everything works.

Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: Update to clm2_3_dev30
Changes made:

Known problem:
	This model core-dumps in the standard configuration due
to a problem with the initialization of icefrac.

Lahey fixes:

	Do some fixes for strict error checking with Lahey compiler when
using multiple constituents.

Numerical Recipes sorting routines replaced:

	Numerical Recipes routines CAN NOT be publically released, so
they were replaced by Tony Craig's implementation of the same alogrithm.

cprnc:

	Fix cprnc so it would work on Solaris. Solution was a Kludge to
get it to work. More work should be done to find the underlying problem.

CCSM2_0_beta45 update:

	Update models/bld and scripts to ccsm2_0_beta45.

CLM2_3_dev30 update:

	Update CLM to clm2_3_dev30.

test-model.pl

	With the new build stuff in place test-model.pl is currently
broken. It will be fixed as soon as possible (which may be after the
model release).

Code reviewed by: myself, mvertens (and input from wcollins, pjr, and boville)
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit) (although DTCOND different)
Changes made:

Output field changes:

	DTCOND -- Changed to be defined by dry static energy instead of
                 temperature to be more consistent with current alogrithms.
                 This change is from Fabrizio Sassi.
	New fields:
		WSPEED -- Wind speed (default maximum)
		FSDSC --- Clearsky downwelling solar flux at surface
		PRECTMX - Maximum precipitation rate
		(Add above to monthly files)
	Put TREFMNAV and TREFMXAV on output monthly files for non-coupled case.

	These changes are in ccsm-bugs as request 19.

Change instances of cam1 to cam2:

	Change occurances of cam1 to cam2 in output file names and code comments.

FLAND on initial files is now LANDFRAC:

	Have initial files that are produced use the name LANDFRAC instead
of FLAND to be consistent with history files. This also put attributes on
the field which didn't happen with the FLAND name. For backwards compatability
allow the names on the initial files to be either LANDFRAC or FLAND.

vertinterp:
	Apply a fix to vertinterp as found by Art Mirin. This fixes a problem
	if the interpolation pressure happens to exactly equal the pressure
	at a data-point.  Recorded in ccsm-bugs as request 29.

Constituents module now has longname data element:

	Add longname to constiuents module and set it as an optional argument
	in add_cnst. When add_cnst called if appropriate set longname to
	something useful.

Coupled:
	Change scripts to look at inputdata/atm/cam2 input directory.
	Fix log-file output problem by adding a if( masterproc) on 
	the "stopping at end of day" print.

Restart files change: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: Update to clm2_3_dev29
Changes to ESMF: Update to ESMF_0_0_2p4
Changes made:

ESMF update: Update to newer version of ESMF with name changes from
	mf_ to esmf_. The newer ESMF simplifies the build by not needing
	dependence on OMP or MPI, so nothing is referenced outside the
	ESMF distribution.

CLM2 update: Update to clm2_3_dev29 which works with ESMF version above.

CCSM Update: Update models/bld and scripts directories to ccsm2_0_beta41
	version of the scripts. Also put PCOLS define in CCSM scripts rather
	than hardcoded in ppgrid.F90. Ran csm.csh test on babyblue and utefe.
	Bit-for-bit with non-SPMD version and bit-for-bit with previous
	model.

CCSM Scatter/Gather aliasing: Get rid of the aliasing (using the same array
	for input and output) in the mpigather and mpiscatter calls in 
	ccsm_msg.F90. In the process create a new allocatable array allocated
	on masterproc and an old array allocatable so that only dimensioned
	from beglat:endlat. This reduces the total amount of memory needed 
	for the mpi scatters and gathers.

Solaris: Fix a couple subscript problems caught on solaris in history.F90.
	Then as a particularly difficult problem was caught, turn subscript
	checking off for solaris when DEBUG=TRUE.

phys_grid.F90: Get updates from Pat Worley and Art Mirin to generalize 
	phys_grid.F90 in cam1 for odd numbers for FV dynamics. Tried same
	routine in ccm366 physics, but results in problems.

ORNL -Colt: Add settings needed to CAM_lab.pm to run on colt.ccs.ornl.gov.

Testing: Ran at least some test-model.pl tests on all platforms:

	Linux-PGI (Apache, longs), Linux-Lahey (Apache, compile test on longs)
	Linux-PGI/GCC (Apache, longs), SGI (utefe), IBM (babyblue, eagle@ornl),
	Solaris (sanitas, test 1 works), Compaq (colt@ornl tests 2-5 with SPDM off)

	There are problems with some of the standard tests in test-model.pl
	on particular platforms. These problems will need to be cleanup in
	before model release.

Changes answers: new-physics
Changes to CLM land-model: Interface changes
Control cases:
	/EATON/csm/fv2x-fland05   -- Finite-Volume with PCMDI SST's.
	/JET/csm/sldnewicefrac01  -- SLD dynamics with PCMDI SST's.
	/ROSINSKI/csm/newsstclim03 - Eulerian dynamics with Hurrell
		Hadley Center OI / Reynolds blended SST data climatology.
	/ROSINSKI/csm/newsstamip02 - Eulerian dynamics with Hurrell
		blended monthly SST data.
Changes made:

Physics:

	Fractional land and ocean: Old binary ORO flag is gone replaced
	by the fractions: landfrac, icefrac, and ocnfrac. Also the old
	flag on SST datasets is done away with and ice-cov is used for
	sea-ice concentrations. comsrf.F90 was reworked as part of this change.
	Also the offline tool "definesurf" was changed to work with the
	new datasets. "interpic" continues to work with IC files as well.

	New ice-model: A modified version of the CCSM Sea-Ice model
	Community Sea-Ice Model (csim4) is included with the model
        now in the "models/ice/csim4" directory. The old ice-model is
	included in the new directory "models/atm/cam/src/ocnsice/dataicemodel".

CCM3.6.6 Physics:

	The CCM3.6.6 physics is still supported although now it can ONLY
	be run with Eulerian dynamics/LSM and the old data ice/sst model.
	The old version of the data ice model codes are in the "physics/ccm366"
	directory.

Namelist changes:

	prognostic_icesnow -- If TRUE determine snow-depth over ice prognostically
		otherwise use a climatology.
	reset_csim_iceprops -- Reset the CSIM ice-model initial properties
		(used on a new initial run if the model blows up).

Script / Makefile changes:

	Filepath, datasets and new variable "ICEMODEL" added to deal with
	the two ice-models (CSIM4 or CCMDATA). Lahey error-checking added
	to Makefile. Initial datasets now require the land-fraction on
	them in the variable "FLAND". When using the new ice model 
	SST datasets are required to have the variables "SST_cpl" (for SST), 		and "ice_cov" for sea-ice concentration.

	"NEWBUILD=TRUE" option now the only way to use the standard makefile.
	The old "makdep" dependency generator logic ripped out of the Makefile
	and deleted from the "tools/makdep" directory.

	Users guide updated to reflect changes. DatasetLog updated with
	new datasets.

New datasets:
	To obtain the new tar-ball of datasets:

	ftp ftp.cgd.ucar.edu
	cd pub/erik
	bin
	get cam1_8.scidac-atm.datasets.tar.gz

Error-growth:

	Error-growth is much faster than previous versions of the model.
	Error-growth is still high using the dataicemodel and active-land.
	Using prognostic_icesnow=.false. improves error-growth, and using
	standard T42L26 datasets provides reasonable error-growth. Also
	running error-growth with aqua_planet on provides reasonable error-growth.

Coupled model:

	landfrac, and ocnfrac are now binary values of 0.0 or 1.0 in
	accordance to how ORO was previously assigned in the model. This
	should eventually be changed to use the values the coupler send
	explicitly.

test-model.pl:

	Change restart tests to restart after 5 time steps.
	Change error-growth full-physics test to use prognostic_icesnow=.false.
	and aqua_planet=.true. and use date from dataset rather than Dec/31.
	Delete the SOM test and add a new test to make sure using the
	dataicemodel works.
	Fix problem with recognizing old files.

interpsst gone:

	The old tools/interpsst code removed as it will not work with the
	new SST files. Also new tools for creating SST datasets are in 
	development. The new tools use the Hurrell SST datasets and also
	modify data so that when a linear time-interpolation is applied
	to the mid-monthly datapoints the observed monthly average is
	reconstructed. It's unclear when the new tools will become part
	of the distribution.

Changes to make most of the model Lahey compliant:

	Small changes to large amounts of the code so that strict error-checking
	with the Lahey compiler can be performed on most of the model. The
	files: binary_io.F90, wrap_nf.F90, wrap_mpi.F90 have not been converted.
	As part of this change the routines bouyan, and cldprp where moved
	to inside the zm_conv.F90 file.

Bug-fixes:

	Fix in phys_grid.F90 for SGI.
	Fix in filenames.F90 for IBM.

Known problems:

	IBM -- history.F90 still doesn't always compile when DEBUG=TRUE.
	Compaq -- Model core-dumps with "floating invalid" when running
		error-growth test on Compaq (Colt @ ORNL)
	The model compiles but has trouble running on the Sun. Subscript overflow
		problem when running compiler checking (Sanitas @ NCAR).
	Linux-PGI -- fv: When running FV dynamics and Error-growth the model
		aborts with an error 
                  "DEALLOCATE: memory at 43d18c10 not allocated"
                (Apache @ NCAR)

	SOM -- New model does not work with the slab-ocean model.

   guaranteeing that the same number of chunks can be assigned
   to each processor. Files affected:

2) Augmented physics domain decomposition options:
   opt == -1: same as before (latitude-slice chunk, for compatibility
               with ccm366 physics, lsm1, and CSM)
   opt == 0:  For a given MPI process, all chunks have the same number
              of columns, and each thread associated with a process has
              the same number of chunks. Columns are assigned to chunks 
              to improve load balance between chunks (compared to
              the default ordering), but without requiring 
              interprocessor communication in dp_coupling.  
   opt == 1:  All chunks have the same number of columns and each
              thread has the same number of chunks, across all MPI
              processes. Columns are assigned to chunks to balance
              day/night, summer/winter "static" load imbalances. 
              Chunks are assigned to processes to minimize interprocessor
              communication in dp_coupling, but it will occur
              anyway unless the dynamics decomposition is compatbile.

One-line Summary: Fix labels on monthly files, physics changes from mzh6,

Known bug: All precipitation appears as snowfall!
Requires change in build system: no
Substantial timing or memory changes: no
Requires change in run script: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: Yes!
Machines tested: IBM, Linux (PGI)
Ran test-model.pl script: yes (does all of the following tests)

Tested that different domain decompositions match bit-for-bit: yes
Tested in adiabatic mode: yes
Code reviewed by: myself, mvertens
Restart files change: no
Changes answers: Yes! (same-physics -- less snowfall, reduced Cn over sea-ice)
	Case names for changes: /CCSM/csm/b20.001
Changes made:

Bug introduced:

	This version introduces a bug where all precipitation appears as snow.
This was due to incorrectly resolving a conflict in the merge from mzh5 to
mzh6.

Fix labels on monthly files:

Monthly files were labeled with the current time-stamp. Now they are labeled
with the previous month. Also don't output a monthly file, if nstep == 0,
as it will just be an instantaneous time-sample rather than an average.

Get code updates from ccm3_12_47_brnchT_mzh6:

Snowfall is reduced by requring average temperature to be -2C. Reduce cloud
condensation nuclei over sea-ice from 40 to 5. These code changes were tested
coupled, but not stand-alone yet. Both a new coupled and uncoupled simulation
will be run shortly.

Fix log-files when running coupled:

Only redirect masterproc output to atm.log file. Redirecting all output was
causing conflicts in the log file and causing most of the information
to be lost. Also add more checks on masterproc for output when running coupled.

Update CCSM scripts to ccsm2_0_beta38:

Update the "models/bld" and "scripts" directories to point to the "beta38"
version of CCSM2.0.

Change test-model.pl. SOM test now run on all platforms (AIX was left
off before). $CASE is a little longer and more descriptive. Filewildcard
more explicit (solves a simple problem I ran into, where the old file
was found).

Ran run-model.pl with a 32-character caseid (both with CLM and LSM) 
producing initial files to make sure worked with long caseid, and 
initial files had proper name.

Requires change in build system: yes
	(SHELL_MSS is no longer required)
Substantial timing or memory changes: no
Requires change in run script: no
	(namelist options changed: rirt, nrmvn, nsmvn removed, irt => mss_irt,

Code reviewed by: myself, mvertens, eaton
Restart files change: yes!
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: Update to CLM2.3.17, get to work with changes
Changes made:

Flexible filenames:

	New namelist option, hfilename_spec to specify filenames, newly
adopted CCSM standard filenames are the default. Filename specifiers set
the filenames, with the following interpretations:

	%c = casid
	%t = tape number
	%y = current year
	%m = month
	%d = day
	%s = seconds into current day
	%% = % character

By default non-monthly files have a hfilename_spec of: "%c.cam1.h%t.%y-%m-%d-%s.nc"
Hence, for example, with a caseid="test", tape number 2, writing it's first data
for 12/1 UT 0:0 for year 1, will have the filename: 
"test.cam1.h1.0001-12-01-00000.nc".

Namelist:

	nsmvn, nrmvn, and rirt removed from namelist.
	old irt renamed to mss_irt
	old nswrps renamed to mss_wpass

	Added hfilename_spec filename specifyer to history filenames.
	Added archive_dir to give MSS archive directory 

	(now defaults to /USERNAME/caseid/csm/atm).

Filenames module:

	New module to deal with filenames, and MSS options and interpret
filename specifiers (as above). Unit-test for this module was created.

Restarts:

	history and abs-ems restart full filepaths added to master restart file.
Restart pointer file changed to include information on all files needed to
successfully do a restart. Restart files are disposed to MSS when closed
rather than in wrapup.

History:

	History filenames are created and opened when data is first written to 
them. Added methods: get_mtapes, get_hist_restart_filepath, get_hfilepath
to get private data in history module. Increase length of filenames to 256.

CCSM scripts:

	models/bld updated to ccsm2_0_beta35, scripts updated to 
scripts_a011228_brnchT_a020201. system_test script updated to changes in these
scripts. atm.setup.csh updated for new namelist changes.

test-model.pl:

	New SOM dataset names added. Changed test-model.pl to use NEWBUILD
mechanism which should speedup build, changed so that error-growth tests
run without trace-gas, but with readtrace to exercise more code options. Set
nhtfrq(1) for restart tests so that all history files produce restart files.
Change Makefile so that explicit path to mkSrcfiles and mkDepends scripts
is given (using Rootdir).

CLM:

	CLM updated to CLM2.3.17 (uses new CCSM filename convention). Update
to filenames module and namelist change.

Move files unused by CLM from atmlnd_share to control:
	(Testing of files in atmlnd_share is insufficient to work with
	CLM2. So we are working on seperating the two.)
	ioFileMod.F90, gauaw_mod.F90, wrap_mpi.F90
	ioFileMod.F90 changes so that comments, and mvn is not needed, and
	SHELL_MSS option becomes standard.

MSS:

	Remove MSS comments when mswrite done, and remove SHELL_MSS CPP token,
since always used.

> Version: MF_LLU_0.0.12
> One-line summary: Added relocatable build support.
> Changes made:
> 
> -Added variable MF_BUILD, which allows the code to be built in a 
> directory other than the default.  To use, invoke:
>    gmake BOPT=g MF_BUILD=/tmp/esmf_build 
> This will build the library under "/tmp/esmf_build".  The object files,
> the library and the mod files will all be created under the new
> directory.
> 
> -Added an install target to makefile.  The variables MF_LIB_INSTALL
> and MF_MOD_INSTALL determine where the libraries and mod files are
> copyed during the install:  (e.g)
>    gmake BOPT=g MF_BUILD=/tmp/esmf_build MF_LIB_INSTALL=/usr/lib \
>    MF_MOD_INSTALL=/usr/mod install
> (Notice that once the MF_BUILD is used, it must be passed to the
> subsequent make commands).

The CAM Makefile was changed to set the MF_BUILD directory to $(MODEL_EXEDIR)/esmf.

The latest lf95 compiler (lf9561) required the following changes to the source code:

physics/cam1/{radae.F90,chemistry.F90} - removed save attribute in variable
declarations that were in the same scope as a save statement.

(Note: test-model.pl only does checks this -- if you run it with the "-c" option)
Name of tests cases on NCAR Mass-Store: (For changes that change answers)
Changes to CLM land-model: None (one-line description)
Changes made:

Changed history.F90, uv3s_update.F90 and restart_dynamics.F90.
Also changed CAM_lab.pm and script.m4.

Main changes were to history.F90, in order to support 2D FV decomposition.
The field_info structure was generalized to include a vertical extent. Support
for dynamics variables having global vertical extent 1, plev and plevp was added;
however, only tested variables had global extent plev. New coding supports 64-bit
accumulation buffers. 32-bit accumulation buffers are still not supported for
2D FV but are supported for 1D FV decomposition.

Previous coding had bug involving non-preservation of subscript array
range for associated pointers. That bug affected the hbuf_accum routines and
hbuf_compute_avg. Bug has been fixed; inside those routines relevant arrays
have beginning subscript equal to 1.

uv3s_update.F90 needed minor fix to properly call the history routine.

restart_dynamics.F90 had a minor bug involving 2D FV decomposition.

script.m4 (DAO) was given 1-line change involving ccm to cam transition.

CAM_lab.pm had 1-character change involving working directory on LLNL frost.

	in "use" lines.  Upgrade of pilgrim (synchronized with DAO
	Chemistry Transport Model development) and mod_comm (should
	compile on Compaq now).  

	models/utils/pilgrim:

		pilgrim.h, parutilitiesmodule.F90, ghostmodule.F90:
			synchronized with DAO CTM development.
		mod_comm.F90 : should now compile on Compaq (sorry,
			not tested -- no access to a Compaq)

	models/atm/cam/src/control:

		history.F90: rather ugly code to support write of 
			ghosted U3S array.  Well be improved in later version.

	models/atm/cam/src/dynamics/fv

		prognostics : ghosted variables U3S, V3S, Q3

		cd_core.F90, trac2d.F90 : ghosting of U, V, Q3, replaced many
				pilgrim calls with mod_comm.

		benergy.F90, dryairm.F90, inidat.F90, restart_dynamics.F90

Changes made:

	Changed indexing of prognostic var. Q3 from (i,k,iq,j) to
	(i,j,k,iq) in FV dynamical core.  This change affected 
	numerous files in FV,

          cd_core.F90 fv_prints.F90 pmgrid.F90 stepon.F90

        and one common file: src/control/history.F90.

	The section in history is protected by an "if ( dycore_is('LR) ) then"
	line (and is also embedded in an #ifdef STAGGERED CPP statement --
	does any other dycore use STAGGERED?)

	The order of Q3 on the initial/restart files has *not* changed.
	For the time-being there is logic to read and write Q3 in the
	original order.  This might change (in restart_dynamics.F90) later on.


	models/util/pilgrim/mod_comm.F90 has also been upgraded with
	new routines; which are not yet used by the FV core.  A code
	review/revision of these changes by Putman/Shen is pending.

  Use values of constants from models/csm_share/shr_const_mod.F90 for
  consistency with other CCSM component models.  The changes are mainly in
  the physics/cam1/physconst.F90 module.

  Also changed some hard-wired constants in individual parameterizations:

  ocnsice/dom/srftsb.F90
  cmair = cpair             (was 1.00e3)
  cmice = shr_const_cpice   (was 2.07e3)

  rhoocn = shr_const_rhosw          (was 1.026e3) same
  cpocn  = shr_const_cpsw           (now 3.996e3, was 3.930e3)
  tsm = shr_const_tkfrz             (was 273.16)

  physics/cam1/cldwat.F90
  rhonot = rhodair/1000.   (was 1.275e-3)
  t0 = tmelt                         (was 273.16)
  replace hard-wired 273.16 with t0

  physics/cam1/esinti.F90
  pass tmelt as an arg

  physics/cam1/gffgch.F90
  replace hard-wired 273.16 with tmelt

  physics/cam1/radae.F90
  amd = mwdry           (now 28.966, was 28.9644)

  Made some interface changes to provide initialization routines for
  setting constants in parameterizations.

  Moved routines for water vapor pressure calcs into new wv_saturation
  module.

  Moved routines for shallow convection into moistconvection module.

o Added namelist option avgflag_pertape. Usage ex: if set avgflag_pertape(2) = 'I', 
  all fields on history file 2 will by default be instantaneous.  Can still
  be overridden (for example) with fincl2 = 'T:A'

o Deleted inlining for SGI (a mod to bld/Makefile). Inlining slowed compilation 
  down by 60% and resulted in zero or negative speedup.  Could also delete for
  other machines, but Makefile mods, compilation time and execution time effects
  of including inlining were not nearly as obnoxious as on SGI so left alone for now.

o Added addfld call for NSTEP. Writing this field to history file is often useful 
  for diagnosing mods to history.F90.  By default this field is not written.

o Moved dycore print from parse_namelist.F90 to cam.F90

to bld_b011121, and scripts/test.a1 to scripts_a011121. Run csm.csh on babyblue
to make sure would work. Also ran on utefe, but lnd.setup.csh failed due to
a "getdata" problem, the compile of CAM was successful however. Update "csm.csh"
coupled version to ccsm2_0_beta26.

Change ccsm_msg.F90 to use time_manager to get nstep (from Lawrence Buja).

Version: CAM1.7.dev8
One-line Summary: add perpetual calendar option to time manager
Requires change in build system: no
Substantial timing or memory changes: no
Requires change in run script: no
Tested to work coupled with CCSM: no
Machines tested: IBM, SGI, Compaq, pc-linux, sun
Ran test-model.pl script: yes (does all of the following tests)

Tested on eul dynamics: yes
Tested on sld dynamics: yes
Tested that restarts are bit-for-bit: yes
Tested multiple constituents: yes

Code reviewed by: myself
Updated the DatasetLog (for new input data-files): no
Updated the documentation: Yes
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Name of tests cases on NCAR Mass-Store:
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes made:

Add namelist variables to enable perpetual calendar:

logical perpetual_run - Set to .true. to specify that a perpetual run is
                        being done (default is .false.).  If perpetual_ymd
                        is not set then read the perpetual date from the
                        initial file.

integer perpetual_ymd - Perpetual date specified as (year*1000 + month*100
                        + day).  This overrides value from initial file.

If aqua_planet=.true. then the values of perpetual_run and perpetual_ymd
are ignored.  aqua_planet mode uses a perpetual date of 321.

Modify files:

control/time_manager.F90 - add perpetual_run, perpetual_ymd to public data.
add is_perpetual method to indicate that perpetual calendar is in use.
Modify internal logic so that perpetual calendar doesn't depend on
aqua_planet mode.  Add an optional argument to specify an offset in the
get_curr_date method (needed by the CLM).

control/parse_namelist.F90 - add perpetual_run, perpetual_ymd.

Modify code in the following files to use the perpetual date when
interpolating boundary datasets if perpetual calendar is in use.
control/initext.F90
control/oznini.F90
control/oznint.F90
control/so4bnd.F90
dom/sst_data.F90
physics/advnce.F90
physics/chemistry.F90
physics/tphysac.F90

Misc:
control/initext.F90 - There was code in a #ifdef COUP_CSM section that was
nested inside a #if (!defined COUP_CSM) section.  Remove this code which
wasn't being executed anyway.

Version: CAM1.7.dev6
One-line Summary: Update ESMF to MF_LLU_0_0_11, change test-model.pl interface, 		fix problem with run-model.pl
Requires change in build system: Yes
(Changed Makefile on sun to be compatable with new ESMF)
(Changed Makefile for Linux-PGF90 so sgexx.F doesn't get compiled with -fast)

Tested in adiabatic mode: yes
Code reviewed by: myself, Mariana Vertenstein
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes to ESMF: Update to MF_LLU_0_0_11
Changes made:

ESMF Update:

	Get newer version of ESMF library. This fixes a problem with calculating
the ending date (which fixes a problem that the CLM had in writing out restart
files at the end of the run). It also fixes problems in building on several
platforms. The previous version did not build on the DAO SGI (tropic) for 
example.

Makefile changes:

	SUN: Use -dalign for DEBUG, and otherwise -fast to be compatable
	with the new version of ESMF.

	Linux-PGF90: Set to compile sgexx.F withotu -fast, so that SLD 
	simulations won't hang.

run-model.pl change:
	Change so that CAM_run.pm sets up a directory to build makdep in
	like test-model.pl does. This allows run-model.pl to use the same
	source directory, but submit to different machines simultaneously.
	The change requires the setup_directories( "support" ) method to
	be called from run-model.pl type scripts.

test-model.pl changes:

	Change interface from mixed short names like "-l" and "-nofail" to
consistent longer names: "-lab", "-compare", "-help" etcetera.

	-l     ==> -lab
	-c     ==> -compare
	-h     ==> -help
	-t     ==> Eliminated you now get the list of test from -help
	-r     ==> -resume
	-dirty ==> -noclean
	-e     ==> -errgro
	-s     ==> -skip

For backwards compatability, -l, -c, -r, -e, and -s are still allowed, although
the longer names are prefered.

ornl: Change default CASE_DIR to a GPFS directory so that builds will work.
llnl: Change default SPMG_CMND depending on whether machine has prun or dmpirun.
      Will now automatically detect which exists and use the one that works.

Modified the CAM Makefile to prevent unnecessary rebuilding of the ESMF
library.

The ESMF Makefile has been improved (by David Neckels) to include support for
more Fortran compilers under Linux, and to allow simultaneous builds of the
library from different platforms with access to the same source on a shared
filesystem.  There is also a README file for the ESMF build in
top_dir/models/utils/esmf/README.

Changes to CLM land-model: None
Changes to ESMF: Update to MF_LLU_0_0_10p1
Changes made:

Fix path problems with run-model.pl

	Add a condense-path.pl utility to shorten pathnames with "/.." in them.
This is important since the longer directory names of CAM and the multiple
levels cause line length problems when building.

test-model.pl: Turn SOM test on for all platforms but AIX

	Let the SOM test happen for all platforms except the IBM where it fails.
Once this is fixed we should re-enable it.

Changes to CLM land-model: YES
Changes made (CLM2 code):
Put in changes from clm2_2_12, clm2_2_13, clm_2_14	
	
clm2_2_12:
1) Update to clm2 changes from CCM3.12.62, from Brian Eaton 
   "Use public data and methods from time_manager mod for initialization."
	
clm2_2_13:
1) cleaned up pft physiology file and related code 
   removed anything related to biogeochemistry when DGVM is off (not defined)
2) used ratio of roughness length and displacement height to canopy top height
   instead of actual values for roughness lenght and displacement height
3) fixed openmp bug in RtmMod.F90
4) fixed branch bug in AccumulMod.F90
5) fixed DGVM bug in Fire.F90
	
clm2_2_14:	
The clm2 code in this tag is clm2_2_14 with Erik's cam1_7_1 mods
where ccm->cam in various files min the clm2/main directory	
1) (Biogeophysics_Lake.F90) - Fixed bug in lake model where latent heat of
   fusion was being used (incorrect) instead of latent heat of sublimation
   (correct).
   Also Fixed two "problems" noticed in the b202.20.0 simulations: 
2) (CombineSnowLayers.F90) -  Global water and ice contents in the 
   top soil layer were increasing with time. Eliminated ponding in 
   wetlands by assigning snow melt to runoff.
3) (SurfaceRunoff.F90) - Eliminated formation and growth of basal ice layer 
   beneath snow cover by assigning snow melt reaching impermeable ground 
   surface to surface runoff. 
   The above three fixes were tested by examining output from several single
   point and 21-year standalone simulations. No trends in surface soil
   water and ice were noted. Lake bug fix has small effects on surface
   fluxes from grid cells with lakes that have snow cover.
4) Put in volr in initial dataset
5) Put in restart id tag on restart file for consistency -
   if restart file is modified, the parameter rest_id in restFileMod.F90
   must be updated.
6) Set maximum number of auxillary history files to 2 to be
   consistent with parameter settings.

One-line Summary: Move from CCM to CAM, mask error-growth problems by not 
	letting CLM see snowfall, Change build
Requires change in build system: Yes!

Updated the DatasetLog (for new input data-files): no (but need to)
	Did create 26 level T21 datasets for testing, and got test-datasets
	at T42L18 for SOM
	(new datasets at ftp.cgd.ucar; cd pub/erik; 
         get cam1_7.scidac-atm.datasets.tar.gz)
Updated the documentation: Yes (first pass at changes from CCM to CAM)
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes to CLM land-model: Yes (COUP_CCM to COUP_CAM, nix references to ccm)
Changes made:

Change references from CCM to CAM.

datafiles: ccmr and ccmi files are now camr and cami
filenames: ccm3, conv_ccm, ccmoce, are now cam, conv_cam, camoce
lnd filenames: ccm_lndMod, lnd_ccmMod, are now atm_lndMod, and lnd_atmMod
CPP Tokens: COUP_CCM is now COUP_CAM
Directory structure: New directory structure compatable with the "cam1"
	cvs module rather than the "ccm" cvs module.
Other references in code and comments to CCM were changed to CAM.

New build:

	Build changed to create a Rootdir file with the top level directory
of "cam1". This is used by the Makefile to figure out the location of the ESMF
directory. The Makefile then builds the ESMF library directly from the 
Makefile. This new build system comes from David Neckels via Brian Eaton.
It is a much easier more robust way of building the model. The env variable 
DYNAMICS for Lin-Rood should now be set to "fv" in agreement with the new directory name. For the SUN take out the "-fast" option to be compatible with the
ESMF library build (put this back in when ESMF build is updated).

Run scripts:

Run scripts use "CSMDATA" instead of MODEL_DATDIR. AM_DATDIR, and LM_DATDIR 
env variables removed. New directory structure for cam with subdirectories
for: inic, ggas, rad, hrtopo, ozone, scyc, and sst for initial conditions, 
greenhouse gas, radiation, high-resolution topography, ozone, sulfur-cycle
and sea surface temperatures respectively. The environment variable OCEAN
was added to refer to the ocean model to use "dom" or "som". The env variable
PHYSICS now either should be "cam" or "ccm366" to refer to the type of physics
used.

Error-growth problem:

	Mask the current error-growth problem to some extent by only letting
CLM see rain and not snowfall. Error-growth for FV still seems to be large.

Remove Sulfur-cycle codes:

	Remove the sulfur-cycle codes (they are still accessible on the 
cam_brnch_scyc branch and with the cam1_scyc module). In their place the
dummy stubs from dscyc were put into the control directory. Eventually, we
will rip these out of the main development and only leave them on the 
sulfur-cycle branch.

Changes to test-model.pl:

	Change vertical resolution of the sld and eul tests to 26, in agreement
with the vertical resolution used for production simulations (the difference
in vertical resolution can have an impact on how changes to physics are 
perceived). Remove "-clean" option and make cleaning old directories out the
default, add the option "-dirty" to not clean files before the build. 

Users Guide:

	Users Guide now part of the distribution, first pass on moving from
CCM3.12 to CAM was completed. Namelist documentation is up to date, directory
structure is outlined. Further updates should update documentation at the
same time that code is changed.

SOM:

	SOM now part of the distribution, SOM was updated to use the new 
timing routines. "test-model.pl" has a test for SOM that is currently commented
out since it doesn't run on the IBM (does complete on other platforms however).

Changes made:

IMPORTANT: Problems on SUN, and Linux, problems on batch submission to: 
           blue, eagle, gseaborg (see below). Need new datasets (see below).
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Physical changes:
	Precipitation evaporation: 		J.J. Hack.
	Cloud water changes for mid-atm.:	P.J. Rasch
	LW water-vapor abs/ems changes: 	W.   Collins
	no orographic drag over ocean: 	B.B. Boville
	fix to geo-potential:		B.B. Boville

Land-model:
	Tested with both LSM1 and CLM2 land-models (see below). CLM2
	was updated to CLM2.1.20.
Interface changes:
	Makefile changed so that in-lining is done.
	radems/radabs became a module.
	LINUX CPP token changed to Linux (so you can use uname -s)
	Block data removed (except for phys366).
	Check that ORO is valid from IC file.
Testing:
	Code was tested both on many NCAR platforms and several off-site 
	platforms as well. test-model.pl was primarily used to validate 
	that the model started/restarted for all dynamics as well as 
	both the "physics" and "phys366" physics directories and "lsm1" 
	and "clm2" land models.  It also verified that restarts give exact 
	answers to the history files (both average and instant values), 
	and that changing the decomposition gives the same answers and 
	that SPMD and non-SPMD gives the same answers. It also checks 
	that the code can run with bounds checking on (on Sun and Linux), 
	and with the compiler initializing variables to indefinite.

	CCSM tests run ccm/test/csm.csh to ensure that the model works 
	with the CCSM coupler.  This version of the model works with 
	ccsm2_0_beta11.

Error growth:
	The error-growth is faster than the previous model, especially 
	SLD but, it was deemed acceptable. HOWEVER, 
	THE ERROR-GROWTH ON THE SUN IN COMPARISON TO THE IBM IS 
	UNACCEPTABLE. Until this is fixed the Sun should not be 
	used for simulations.

Script changes: 
	test-model.pl was made more robust. Tests
	to compare SPMD non-SPMD were added and to check both avg
	and instant history files for restart tests, and new 
	input options added:

	set the env variables:

	LANDMODEL --- to define whether to use LSM1 or CLM2
	PHYSICS ----- to define whether to use "phys366" or "physics".

	skip option (-s) now allows an end-point and allows resolution
	to be specified. So

	-s eul:3-5:T42L26

	Will run tests 3-5 with Eulerian dynamics at T42 and 26 levels.

	Error-growth option. To do a port validation you can validate
	against a given trusted machine. To do this use something like:

	-e "blackforest.ucar.edu(aix)"

	This assumes you already ran test-model.pl on blackforest (and
	left everything in the standard locations). Then the "errg*.cprout"
	files will contain a comparison to the above machine.

New datasets:
	Bundle of datasets needed to run the model and use "test-model.pl".

		ftp.cgd.ucar.edu; cd pub/erik; bin; 
		get ccm3.12.acpi-atm.datasets.tar.gz

	abs_ems_factors_fastvx.052001.nc --- Required for use with 
						the new LW code.
	clm datasets  ---- 	In order to run with clm2.
	fv.4x5L18 -------- 	4x5 degree resolution dataset with 18 levels 
				for LR dynamics from Sharon Nebuda.
Known-Bugs:
	Linux: S.-J. had trouble with 10x15 on Linux with LR and the 
		Portland group compiler. I had trouble with Linux at 
		2x2.5 with LR.
	Sun: 	Error-growth was bad. Ran out of memory at some resolutions, 
		especially when doing SPMD, or when using CLM2.
	Batch: Had trouble with batch submission on the IBM-SP machines: 
		blue, gseaborg, and eagle.  Interactive, didn't have the 
		same trouble, so I'm unclear why this is the case.
	test-model.pl: When using "-s all:" option you can't give an 
			end-point or it will only run for the first dynamics.
Changes since CCM3.11:
	Many enhancements, bug-fixes, and progress on 2D-decompostion to LR
	dynamics. Update to F90 and initial Protex pass for LR.

ccm3_8
Originator: rosinski ( ROSINSKI JIM 1397 ML CGD)
Date: Fri Aug 20 11:24:07 MDT 1999
Model: CCM
Version: CCM3.8
One-line Summary: Merged netcdfhtape branch to trunk
Requires change in build system: Yes.  makdep now required.  New Makefile
Requires change in run script: Yes.  Namelist changes.
Run through comtest.spectral.csh and comtest.sld.csh: Yes
Run through csm.test.nqs: no
Updated the DatasetLog: no
Changes answers: no (bit-for-bit)
Changes made:

	o Model now writes netcdf history tapes.
	o Requires f90 compiler since modules and allocatable arrays are
	  used.  Code now should be fully f90-compliant.  No more Cray 
	  pointers or user-defined Fortran interfaces to malloc.
	o Cloud water is a non-advected tracer as opposed to advecting it
	  and throwing away the results of the advection (mvertens).
	o Model at least runs on IBM.  Have not done error growth analysis.
	o Moved time filter and mass fixer to scan2.  This became possible
	  with the time-split physics.
	o Precision now specified in code rather than relying on vendor flag
	  (e.g. -r8). This change has not yet been put in the library code 
	  (e.g. ecmfft), so -r8 flag (or equivalent) is still needed for 
	  these files.
	o Build procedure now REQUIRES use of the makdep routine provided
	  in tools/makdep.  The reason is that no standard UNIX tool I
	  know of can provide the full dependency analysis needed.
	o Eliminated out-of-core option.  History, radiation, and main
	  model buffers are now modules.  Integer pointers to buffer
	  locations are gone, as are /comgrd/ and points.F
	o Namelist changes:

old namelist                              new namelist
------------                              ------------

ccm3_7
Originator: erik ( Erik Kluzek)
Date: Fri May 28 13:38:40 MDT 1999
Model: CCM
Version: CCM3.7
One-line Summary: Prognostic cloud-water and sulfur cycle
Requires change in build system: Yes 
(new directory scyc)
Requires change in run script: Yes
(need to use readtrace=.F. and cldw_adv=.T.)
Run through comtest.spectral.csh and comtest.sld.csh: Yes
Run through csm.test.nqs: Yes
Updated the DatasetLog (for new input data-files): Yes
Changes answers: yes
Name of tests cases on NCAR Mass-Store: /JET/csm/prgcld01
Changes made:

        Prognostic cloud-water and sulfur cycle put on the CCM development trunk.
Changes are huge, in essense this puts ccm3_6_20_brnchT_scycRad1_13 on the
trunk.  Standard mode to run is now with 30 levels and with the NOAA Ozone
dataset. So use: SEP1.T42L30_diffPHIS.0599.nc and noaao3.1990.21999.nc.
Using these datasets readtrace must be set to FALSE and normal operation
is with cldw_adv TRUE.  To build you must put the "src/scyc" directory in
your path (optionally you can checkout the dscyc module which has dummy
stub routines for the sulfur codes).  The default operation is without any
of the sulfur cycle stuff turned on.

        Caveat's:  MODEL DOES NOT WORK WITH SPMD MODE!
                    CSM was tested to ensure it works, but there were
        changes that haven't had a long simulation done to verify they
        are working correctly.

        SLD mode was tested to ensure it works, but long simulations 
        were not performed.

        Model tested on SGI, Cray, and Sun. But, the most extensive testing
        was on the SGI (ute).

        SOM not tested.  Only dom mode was tested.

        A change was put into the LSM for arbitrary initialization. The
        change is bit-for-bit when not using arbitrary initialization.
        But, new spin-up datasets have not been created nor long-simulations
        with the change (the change makes points southward of 60S land ice and 
        initializes them with a snow depth of 1m).

        Current version does not work with the 44 mid-atmosphere model.

        (a fix is on the way soon).

        Sulfur code has it's own version of the solar zenith angle.  This
        routine is incompatible with the version in csm_share.  This means
        the model should not be used for Paleo simulations, with sulfur cycle
        turned on.
        (a fix is on the way soon).
