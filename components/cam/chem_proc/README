This is the MOZART chemical preprocessor, which has been modified for the
CAM framework.  

This tool creates CAM chemistry source code files (fortran) for a given 
chemical mechanism file (*.inp file).  

Here $PROC_DIR is the top level directory of the chemical preprocessor.

To build:
> cd $PROC_DIR/src
> gmake
This will biuld $PROC_DIR/bin/campp executable.

Edit or create a chemical mechanism file in the $PROC_DIR/inputs
directory.  Example mechanisms files can be found in $PROC_DIR/inputs.
More information the chemical mechanism inputs can be found at 
http://gctm.acd.ucar.edu/mozart/documents/mozart2_preprocessor.pdf

To run:
> cd $PROC_DIR/inputs
> $PROC_DIR/bin/campp mechanism.inp
> cd $PROC_DIR/output
> cp cam.subs.tar $CAM_USRSRC
> cd $CAM_USRSRC
> tar -xvf cam.subs.tar

Include the fortran source files extacted from cam.subs.tar in the
source path of the CAM build by one of the follow methods.
 1) configure CAM with the -usr_src $CAM_USRSRC option
or
 2) copy the new *.F90 files to the trop_mozart directory

Configure and build the new CAM executable.
