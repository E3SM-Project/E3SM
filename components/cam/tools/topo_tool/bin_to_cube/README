This program reads USGS 30-sec terrain dataset from NetCDF file and bins it to an approximately 
3km cubed-sphere grid and outputs the data in netCDF format.

The LANDM_COSLAT field is read in from a separate netCDF file and linearly interpolated to the 3km cubed-sphere grid.

Input files needed:

1. USGS raw data in netCDF format: usgs-rawdata.nc (must be placed in same dirctory as the executables)
   Generated with software in gen_netCDF_from_USGS/ directory

   File may be found at:

   $CESMDATA/inputdata/atm/cam/gtopo30data/usgs-rawdata.nc

2. landm_coslat dataset (must be placed in same dirctory as the executables). E.g.:

   ln -s /fs/cgd/csm/inputdata/atm/cam2/hrtopo/landm_coslat.nc .

   The landm_coslat field is not used in CAM5!

Output file:

USGS-topo-cube.nc
