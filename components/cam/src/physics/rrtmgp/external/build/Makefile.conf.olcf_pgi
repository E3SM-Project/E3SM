# NOTE: There is a bug in the PGI OpenACC implementation related to optimization
# and C-compatible logical types (c_bool). The temporary workaround (until the
# compiler bug is fixed) is to compile without optimization. Alternatively, we
# can change all variables of type logical(wl) or logical(kind=c_bool) with
# intent(in) to intent(inout), which access memory differently. Requiring
# building without optimization seemed like the less intrusive approach for the
# time being though. This allows the tests to build and run, and gives the right
# answers against baselines, but will need to be fixed before running big
# expensive jobs probably.
