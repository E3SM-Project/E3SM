module clip_semi_implicit

  ! Description of the semi-implicit clipping code:
  ! The semi-implicit clipping code is based on an upper threshold and/or a
  ! lower threshold value for variable f.
  !
  ! The semi-implicit clipping code is used when the value of variable f should
  ! not exceed the designated threshold(s) when it is advanced to timestep
  ! index (t+1).
  !
  !
  ! Clipping at an Upper Threshold:
  !
  ! When there is an upper threshold to be applied, the equation for the clipped
  ! value of the variable f, f_clipped, is:
  !
  ! f_clipped(t+1) = MIN( f_unclipped(t+1), upper_threshold )
  !                = ( f_unclipped(t+1) - upper_threshold )
  !                    * H(upper_threshold-f_unclipped(t+1))
  !                  + upper_threshold;
  !
  ! where f_unclipped is the value of the variable f without clipping, and
  ! H(upper_threshold-f_unclipped(t+1)) is the Heaviside Step function.  The
  ! clipping term is turned into a time tendency term, such that:
  !
  ! (df/dt)_clipping = (1/dt_clip)
  !                    * ( f_clipped(t+1) - f_unclipped(t+1) );
  !
  ! where dt_clip is the time scale for the clipping term.  The difference
  ! between the threshold value and f_unclipped is defined as f_diff:
  !
  ! f_diff = upper_threshold - f_unclipped.
  !
  ! The clipping time tendency is now simplified as:
  !
  ! (df/dt)_clipping = + (1/dt_clip)
  !                      * { f_diff(t+1) * [ 1 - H(f_diff(t+1)) ] }.
  !
  ! Function R(f_diff) is defined as:
  !
  ! R(f_diff) = { f_diff * [ 1 - H(f_diff) ] }.
  !
  ! The clipping time tendency is now written as:
  !                
  ! (df/dt)_clipping = + (1/dt_clip) * R(f_diff(t+1)).
  !
  ! In order to solve for f_unclipped (and f_diff) at timestep index (t+1), the
  ! clipping term must be linearized.  A Taylor Series expansion (truncated
  ! after the first derivative term) of R(f_diff) around f_diff = f_diff(t) is
  ! used to linearize the term.  However, the Heaviside Step function,
  ! H(f_diff), is not differentiable when f_diff(t) = 0, as the function jumps
  ! at that point.  Likewise, the function R(f_diff) is not differentiable when
  ! f_diff(t) = 0, as the function has a corner at that point.  Therefore, a new
  ! function, F_R(f_diff) is used as an approximation of R(f_diff).  Function
  ! F_R(f_diff) is a three-piece function that has the exact same value as
  ! R(f_diff) when f_diff <= -sigma or f_diff >= sigma (sigma is an arbitrarily
  ! declared value).  However, when -sigma < f_diff < sigma, a parabolic
  ! function is used to approximate the corner found in R(f_diff).  The
  ! parabolic function needs to have the same values at f_diff = -sigma and
  ! f_diff = sigma as does R(f_diff).  Furthermore, the derivative of the
  ! parabolic function (with respect to f_diff) needs to have the same values at
  ! f_diff = -sigma and f_diff = sigma as does d(R)/d(f_diff).  The parabolic
  ! function that satisfies these properities is:
  ! f_diff - (sigma/4) * [ 1 + (f_diff/sigma) ]^2.
  ! Therefore:
  !
  !               | f_diff;   where f_diff <= -sigma
  !               |
  ! F_R(f_diff) = | f_diff - (sigma/4) * [ 1 + (f_diff/sigma) ]^2;
  !               |    where -sigma < f_diff < sigma
  !               |
  !               | 0;   where f_diff >= sigma;   and
  !
  !                        | 1;   where f_diff <= -sigma
  !                        |
  ! ( d F_R / d f_diff ) = | 1 - (1/2) * [ 1 + (f_diff/sigma) ];
  !                        |    where -sigma < f_diff < sigma
  !                        |
  !                        | 0;   where f_diff >= sigma.
  !
  ! Since, R(f_diff(t+1)) approx.= F_R(f_diff(t+1)), the Taylor Series expansion
  ! is done for F_R(f_diff) around f_diff = f_diff(t) in order to linearize the
  ! term:
  !
  ! F_R(f_diff(t+1)) approx.=
  !    A_fnc + B_fnc * ( f_diff(t+1) - f_diff(t) );
  !
  ! where A_fnc is defined as F_R(f_diff(t)) and B_fnc is defined as
  ! ( d F_R / d f_diff )|_(f_diff=f_diff(t)).
  !
  ! The approximation is substituted into the (df/dt)_clipping equation.  The
  ! rate of change of variable f due to clipping with the upper threshold is:
  !
  ! (df/dt)_clipping
  ! = + (1/dt_clip)
  !     * {   A_fnc - B_fnc * f_diff(t)
  !         + B_fnc * upper_threshold - B_fnc * f_unclipped(t+1) }.
  !
  ! The implicit (LHS) portion of the equation for clipping with the upper
  ! threshold is:
  !
  ! - (1/dt_clip) * B_fnc * f_unclipped(t+1).
  !
  ! Note:  When the term is brought over to the left-hand side, the sign
  !        is reversed and the leading "-" in front of the term is changed
  !        to a "+".
  !
  ! The explicit (RHS) portion of the equation for clipping with the upper
  ! threshold is:
  !
  ! + (1/dt_clip)
  !   * { A_fnc - B_fnc * f_diff(t) + B_fnc * upper_threshold }.
  !
  ! Timestep index (t) stands for the index of the current timestep, while
  ! timestep index (t+1) stands for the index of the next timestep, which is
  ! being advanced to in solving the d(f)/dt equation.
  !
  !
  ! Clipping at a Lower Threshold:
  !
  ! When there is a lower threshold to be applied, the equation for the clipped
  ! value of the variable f, f_clipped, is:
  !
  ! f_clipped(t+1) = MAX( f_unclipped(t+1), lower_threshold )
  !                = ( f_unclipped(t+1) - lower_threshold )
  !                    * H(f_unclipped(t+1)-lower_threshold)
  !                  + lower_threshold;
  !
  ! where f_unclipped is the value of the variable f without clipping, and
  ! H(f_unclipped(t+1)-lower_threshold) is the Heaviside Step function.  The
  ! clipping term is turned into a time tendency term, such that:
  !
  ! (df/dt)_clipping = (1/dt_clip)
  !                    * ( f_clipped(t+1) - f_unclipped(t+1) );
  !
  ! where dt_clip is the time scale for the clipping term.  The difference
  ! between f_unclipped and the threshold value is defined as f_diff:
  !
  ! f_diff = f_unclipped - lower_threshold.
  !
  ! The clipping time tendency is now simplified as:
  !
  ! (df/dt)_clipping = - (1/dt_clip)
  !                      * { f_diff(t+1) * [ 1 - H(f_diff(t+1)) ] }.
  !
  ! Function R(f_diff) is defined as:
  !
  ! R(f_diff) = { f_diff * [ 1 - H(f_diff) ] }.
  !
  ! The clipping time tendency is now written as:
  !
  ! (df/dt)_clipping = - (1/dt_clip) * R(f_diff(t+1)).
  !
  ! The linearization process is the same for the lower threshold as it is for
  ! the upper threshold.  The formulas for A_fnc and B_fnc are the same, but the
  ! values (based on a different f_diff) are different.  The rate of change of
  ! variable f due to clipping with the lower threshold is:
  !
  ! (df/dt)_clipping
  ! = - (1/dt_clip)
  !     * {   A_fnc - B_fnc * f_diff(t)
  !         - B_fnc * lower_threshold + B_fnc * f_unclipped(t+1) }.
  !
  ! The implicit (LHS) portion of the equation for clipping with the lower
  ! threshold is:
  !
  ! - (1/dt_clip) * B_fnc * f_unclipped(t+1).
  !
  ! Note:  When the term is brought over to the left-hand side, the sign
  !        is reversed and the leading "-" in front of the term is changed
  !        to a "+".
  !
  ! The explicit (RHS) portion of the equation for clipping with the lower
  ! threshold is:
  !
  ! - (1/dt_clip)
  !   * { A_fnc - B_fnc * f_diff(t) - B_fnc * lower_threshold }.
  !
  ! All variables in these equations are on the same vertical levels as the
  ! variable f.
  !
  !
  ! Adjustable parameters:
  !
  ! sigma:  sigma is the amount on either side of the threshold value to which
  !         the parabolic function portion of F_R(f_diff) is applied.  The value
  !         of sigma must be greater than 0.  A proportionally larger value of
  !         sigma can be used to effect values of f that are near the threshold,
  !         but not to it or over it.  The close-to-threshold values will be
  !         nudged away from the threshold.
  !
  ! dt_clip:  dt_clip is the clipping time scale.  It can be set equal to the
  !           model timestep, dt, but it doesn't have to be.  Smaller values of
  !           dt_clip produce a greater effect on the clipping term.

    ! Description:
    ! This subroutine computes the values of two functions used in semi-implicit
    ! clipping.  Both of the functions are based on the values of f_diff(t) and
    ! the parameter sigma.  One function is A_fnc, which is F_R(f_diff)
    ! evaluated at f_diff = f_diff(t).  F_R(f_diff) is a three-piece function
    ! that is used to approximate function R(f_diff).  The other function is
    ! B_fnc, the derivative with respect to f_diff of function A_fnc.  In other
    ! words, B_fnc is ( d F_R / d f_diff ) evaluated at f_diff = f_diff(t).
    !
    ! The equation for A_fnc is:
    !
    !         | f_diff(t);   where f_diff(t) <= -sigma
    !         |
    ! A_fnc = | f_diff(t) - (sigma/4) * [ 1 + (f_diff(t)/sigma) ]^2;
    !         |    where -sigma < f_diff(t) < sigma
    !         |
    !         | 0;   where f_diff(t) >= sigma;
    !
    ! while the equation for B_fnc is:
    !
    !         | 1;   where f_diff(t) <= -sigma
    !         |
    ! B_fnc = | 1 - (1/2) * [ 1 + (f_diff(t)/sigma) ];
    !         |    where -sigma < f_diff(t) < sigma
    !         |
    !         | 0;   where f_diff(t) >= sigma;
    !
    ! where timestep index (t) stands for the index of the current timestep.
