  !
  ! The variable zm(k) stands for the momentum level altitude at momentum
  ! level k; the variable zt(k) stands for the thermodynamic level altitude at
  ! thermodynamic level k; the variable invrs_dzt(k) is the inverse distance
  ! between momentum levels (over a central thermodynamic level k); and the
  ! variable invrs_dzm(k) is the inverse distance between thermodynamic levels
  ! (over a central momentum level k).  Please note that in the above diagram,
  ! "invrs_dzt" is denoted "dzt", and "invrs_dzm" is denoted "dzm", such that
  ! 1/dzt is the distance between successive momentum levels k-1 and k (over a
  ! central thermodynamic level k), and 1/dzm is the distance between successive
  ! thermodynamic levels k and k+1 (over a central momentum level k).
  !
  ! The grid setup is compatible with a stretched (unevely-spaced) grid.  Thus,
  ! the distance between successive grid levels may not always be constant.
  !
  ! The following diagram is an example of a stretched grid that is defined on
  ! momentum levels.  The thermodynamic levels are placed exactly halfway
  ! between the momentum levels.  However, the momentum levels do not fall
  ! halfway between the thermodynamic levels.
  !
  !        =============== zm(k+1) ===============
  !
  !
  !
  !        --------------- zt(k+1) ---------------
  !

  !
  !        ===============  zm(k)  ===============

  !
  !        --------------- zt(k-1) ---------------
  !
  ! NOTE:  Any future code written for use in the CLUBB parameterization should
  !        use interpolation formulas consistent with a stretched grid.  The
  !        simplest way to do so is to call the appropriate interpolation
  !        function from this module.  Interpolations should *not* be handled in
  !        the form of:  ( var_zm(k) + var_zm(k-1) ) / 2; *nor* in the form of:
  !        0.5_core_rknd*( var_zt(k+1) + var_zt(k) ).  Rather, all explicit interpolations
  !        should call zt2zm or zm2zt; while interpolations for a variable being
  !        solved for implicitly in the code should use gr%weights_zt2zm (which
  !        refers to interp_weights_zt2zm_imp), or gr%weights_zm2zt (which
  !        refers to interp_weights_zm2zt_imp).
  !
  ! Momentum level 1 is placed at altitude zm_init, which is usually at the
  ! surface.  However, in general, zm_init can be at any altitude defined by the
  ! user.
  !
  ! GP indicates ghost points. Variables located at those levels are not
  ! prognosed, but only used for boundary conditions.

  pure function interpolated_azmk_imp( m_lev ) & 
    result( azt_weight )

    ! Description:
    ! Function used to help in an interpolation of a variable (var_zt) located
    ! on the thermodynamic grid levels (azt) to the momentum grid levels (azm).
    ! This function computes a weighting factor for both the upper thermodynamic
    ! level (k+1) and the lower thermodynamic level (k) applied to the central
    ! momentum level (k).  For the uppermost momentum grid level (k=gr%nz), a
    ! weighting factor for both the thermodynamic level at gr%nz and the
    ! thermodynamic level at gr%nz-1 are calculated based on the use of a
    ! linear extension.  This function outputs the weighting factors at a single
    ! momentum grid level (k).  The formulation used is compatible with a
    ! stretched (unevenly-spaced) grid.  The weights are defined as follows:
    !
    ! ---var_zt(k+1)------------------------------------------- t(k+1)
    !                       azt_weight(t_above) = factor
    ! ===========var_zt(interp)================================ m(k)
    !                       azt_weight(t_below) = 1 - factor
    ! ---var_zt(k)--------------------------------------------- t(k)
    !
    ! The vertical indices t(k+1), m(k), and t(k) correspond with altitudes
    ! zt(k+1), zm(k), and zt(k), respectively.  The letter "t" is used for
    ! thermodynamic levels and the letter "m" is used for momentum levels.
    !
    ! For all levels k < gr%nz:
    !
    ! The formula for a linear interpolation is given by:
    !
    ! var_zt( interp to zm(k) )
    ! = [ ( var_zt(k+1) - var_zt(k) ) / ( zt(k+1) - zt(k) ) ]
    !     * ( zm(k) - zt(k) ) + var_zt(k);
    !
    ! which can be rewritten as:
    !
    ! var_zt( interp to zm(k) )
    ! = [ ( zm(k) - zt(k) ) / ( zt(k+1) - zt(k) ) ]
    !     * ( var_zt(k+1) - var_zt(k) ) + var_zt(k).
    !
    ! Furthermore, the formula can be rewritten as:
    !
    ! var_zt( interp to zm(k) )
    ! = factor * var_zt(k+1) + ( 1 - factor ) * var_zt(k);
    !
    ! where:
    !
    ! factor = ( zm(k) - zt(k) ) / ( zt(k+1) - zt(k) ).
    !
    ! One of the important uses of this function is in situations where the
    ! variable to be interpolated is being treated IMPLICITLY in an equation.
    ! Usually, the variable to be interpolated is involved in a derivative (such
    ! as d(var_zt)/dz in the diagram below).  For the term of the equation
    ! containing the derivative, grid weights are needed for two interpolations,
    ! rather than just one interpolation.  Thus, four grid weights (labeled
    ! A(k), B(k), C(k), and D(k) in the diagram below) are needed.
    !
    ! ---var_zt(k+1)------------------------------------------- t(k+1)
    !                                       A(k)
    ! ===========var_zt(interp)================================ m(k)
    !                                       B(k) = 1 - A(k)
    ! ---var_zt(k)-----------d(var_zt)/dz---------------------- t(k)
    !                                       C(k)
    ! ===========var_zt(interp)================================ m(k-1)
    !                                       D(k) = 1 - C(k)
    ! ---var_zt(k-1)------------------------------------------- t(k-1)
    !
    ! The vertical indices t(k+1), m(k), t(k), m(k-1), and t(k-1) correspond
    ! with altitudes zt(k+1), zm(k), zt(k), zm(k-1), and zt(k-1), respectively.
    ! The letter "t" is used for thermodynamic levels and the letter "m" is used
    ! for momentum levels.
    !
    ! The grid weights, indexed around the central thermodynamic level (k), are
    ! defined as follows:
    !
    ! A(k) = ( zm(k) - zt(k) ) / ( zt(k+1) - zt(k) );
    !
    ! which is the same as "factor" for the interpolation to momentum
    ! level (k).  In the code, this interpolation is referenced as
    ! gr%weights_zt2zm(t_above,mk), which can be read as "grid weight in a zt2zm
    ! interpolation of the thermodynamic level above momentum level (k) (applied
    ! to momentum level (k))".
    !
    ! B(k) = 1 - [ ( zm(k) - zt(k) ) / ( zt(k+1) - zt(k) ) ]
    !      = 1 - A(k);
    !
    ! which is the same as "1 - factor" for the interpolation to momentum
    ! level (k).  In the code, this interpolation is referenced as
    ! gr%weights_zt2zm(t_below,mk), which can be read as "grid weight in a zt2zm
    ! interpolation of the thermodynamic level below momentum level (k) (applied
    ! to momentum level (k))".
    !
    ! C(k) = ( zm(k-1) - zt(k-1) ) / ( zt(k) - zt(k-1) );
    !
    ! which is the same as "factor" for the interpolation to momentum
    ! level (k-1).  In the code, this interpolation is referenced as
    ! gr%weights_zt2zm(t_above,mkm1), which can be read as "grid weight in a
    ! zt2zm interpolation of the thermodynamic level above momentum level (k-1)
    ! (applied to momentum level (k-1))".
    !
    ! D(k) = 1 - [ ( zm(k-1) - zt(k-1) ) / ( zt(k) - zt(k-1) ) ]
    !      = 1 - C(k);
    !
    ! which is the same as "1 - factor" for the interpolation to momentum
    ! level (k-1).  In the code, this interpolation is referenced as
    ! gr%weights_zt2zm(t_below,mkm1), which can be read as "grid weight in a
    ! zt2zm interpolation of the thermodynamic level below momentum level (k-1)
    ! (applied to momentum level (k-1))".
    !
    ! Additionally, as long as the central thermodynamic level (k) in the above
    ! scenario is not the uppermost thermodynamic level or the lowermost
    ! thermodynamic level (k /= gr%nz and k /= 1), the four weighting factors
    ! have the following relationships:  A(k) = C(k+1) and B(k) = D(k+1).
    !
    !
    ! Special condition for uppermost grid level, k = gr%nz:
    !
    ! The uppermost momentum grid level is above the uppermost thermodynamic
    ! grid level.  Thus, a linear extension is used at this level.
    !
    ! For level k = gr%nz:
    !
    ! The formula for a linear extension is given by:
    !
    ! var_zt( extend to zm(k) )
    ! = [ ( var_zt(k) - var_zt(k-1) ) / ( zt(k) - zt(k-1) ) ]
    !     * ( zm(k) - zt(k-1) ) + var_zt(k-1);
    !
    ! which can be rewritten as:
    !
    ! var_zt( extend to zm(k) )
    ! = [ ( zm(k) - zt(k-1) ) / ( zt(k) - zt(k-1) ) ]
    !     * ( var_zt(k) - var_zt(k-1) ) + var_zt(k-1).
    !
    ! Furthermore, the formula can be rewritten as:
    !
    ! var_zt( extend to zm(k) )
    ! = factor * var_zt(k) + ( 1 - factor ) * var_zt(k-1);
    !
    ! where:
    !
    ! factor = ( zm(k) - zt(k-1) ) / ( zt(k) - zt(k-1) ).
    !
    ! Due to the fact that a linear extension is being used, the value of factor
    ! will be greater than 1.  The weight of thermodynamic level k = gr%nz on
    ! momentum level k = gr%nz equals the value of factor.  The weight of
    ! thermodynamic level k = gr%nz-1 on momentum level k = gr%nz equals
    ! 1 - factor, which is less than 0.  However, the sum of the two weights
    ! equals 1.

    ! momentum level at 2 are calculated based on the use of a linear extension.
    ! This function outputs the weighting factors at a single thermodynamic grid
    ! level (k).   The formulation used is compatible with a stretched
    ! (unevenly-spaced) grid.  The weights are defined as follows:
    !
    ! ===var_zm(k)============================================= m(k)
    !                       azm_weight(m_above) = factor
    ! -----------var_zm(interp)-------------------------------- t(k)
    !                       azm_weight(m_below) = 1 - factor
    ! ===var_zm(k-1)=========================================== m(k-1)
    !
    ! The vertical indices m(k), t(k), and m(k-1) correspond with altitudes
    ! zm(k), zt(k), and zm(k-1), respectively.  The letter "t" is used for
    ! thermodynamic levels and the letter "m" is used for momentum levels.
    !
    ! For all levels k > 1:
    !
    ! The formula for a linear interpolation is given by:
    !
    ! var_zm( interp to zt(k) )
    ! = [ ( var_zm(k) - var_zm(k-1) ) / ( zm(k) - zm(k-1) ) ]
    !     * ( zt(k) - zm(k-1) ) + var_zm(k-1);
    !
    ! which can be rewritten as:
    !
    ! var_zm( interp to zt(k) )
    ! = [ ( zt(k) - zm(k-1) ) / ( zm(k) - zm(k-1) ) ]
    !     * ( var_zm(k) - var_zm(k-1) ) + var_zm(k-1).
    !
    ! Furthermore, the formula can be rewritten as:
    !
    ! var_zm( interp to zt(k) )
    ! = factor * var_zm(k) + ( 1 - factor ) * var_zm(k-1);
    !
    ! where:
    !
    ! factor = ( zt(k) - zm(k-1) ) / ( zm(k) - zm(k-1) ).
    !
    ! One of the important uses of this function is in situations where the
    ! variable to be interpolated is being treated IMPLICITLY in an equation.
    ! Usually, the variable to be interpolated is involved in a derivative (such
    ! as d(var_zm)/dz in the diagram below).  For the term of the equation
    ! containing the derivative, grid weights are needed for two interpolations,
    ! rather than just one interpolation.  Thus, four grid weights (labeled
    ! A(k), B(k), C(k), and D(k) in the diagram below) are needed.
    !
    ! ===var_zm(k+1)=========================================== m(k+1)
    !                                       A(k)
    ! -----------var_zm(interp)-------------------------------- t(k+1)
    !                                       B(k) = 1 - A(k)
    ! ===var_zm(k)===========d(var_zm)/dz====================== m(k)
    !                                       C(k)
    ! -----------var_zm(interp)-------------------------------- t(k)
    !                                       D(k) = 1 - C(k)
    ! ===var_zm(k-1)=========================================== m(k-1)
    !
    ! The vertical indices m(k+1), t(k+1), m(k), t(k), and m(k-1) correspond
    ! with altitudes zm(k+1), zt(k+1), zm(k), zt(k), and zm(k-1), respectively.
    ! The letter "t" is used for thermodynamic levels and the letter "m" is used
    ! for momentum levels.
    !
    ! The grid weights, indexed around the central momentum level (k), are
    ! defined as follows:
    !
    ! A(k) = ( zt(k+1) - zm(k) ) / ( zm(k+1) - zm(k) );
    !
    ! which is the same as "factor" for the interpolation to thermodynamic
    ! level (k+1).  In the code, this interpolation is referenced as
    ! gr%weights_zm2zt(m_above,tkp1), which can be read as "grid weight in a
    ! zm2zt interpolation of the momentum level above thermodynamic
    ! level (k+1) (applied to thermodynamic level (k+1))".
    !
    ! B(k) = 1 - [ ( zt(k+1) - zm(k) ) / ( zm(k+1) - zm(k) ) ]
    !      = 1 - A(k);
    !
    ! which is the same as "1 - factor" for the interpolation to thermodynamic
    ! level (k+1).  In the code, this interpolation is referenced as
    ! gr%weights_zm2zt(m_below,tkp1), which can be read as "grid weight in a
    ! zm2zt interpolation of the momentum level below thermodynamic
    ! level (k+1) (applied to thermodynamic level (k+1))".
    !
    ! C(k) = ( zt(k) - zm(k-1) ) / ( zm(k) - zm(k-1) );
    !
    ! which is the same as "factor" for the interpolation to thermodynamic
    ! level (k).  In the code, this interpolation is referenced as
    ! gr%weights_zm2zt(m_above,tk), which can be read as "grid weight in a zm2zt
    ! interpolation of the momentum level above thermodynamic level (k) (applied
    ! to thermodynamic level (k))".
    !
    ! D(k) = 1 - [ ( zt(k) - zm(k-1) ) / ( zm(k) - zm(k-1) ) ]
    !      = 1 - C(k);
    !
    ! which is the same as "1 - factor" for the interpolation to thermodynamic
    ! level (k).  In the code, this interpolation is referenced as
    ! gr%weights_zm2zt(m_below,tk), which can be read as "grid weight in a zm2zt
    ! interpolation of the momentum level below thermodynamic level (k) (applied
    ! to thermodynamic level (k))".
    !
    ! Additionally, as long as the central momentum level (k) in the above
    ! scenario is not the lowermost momentum level or the uppermost momentum
    ! level (k /= 1 and k /= gr%nz), the four weighting factors have the
    ! following relationships:  A(k) = C(k+1) and B(k) = D(k+1).
    !
    !
    ! Special condition for lowermost grid level, k = 1:
    !
    ! The lowermost thermodynamic grid level is below the lowermost momentum
    ! grid level.  Thus, a linear extension is used at this level.  It should
    ! be noted that the thermodynamic level k = 1 is considered to be below the
    ! model lower boundary, which is defined to be at momentum level k = 1.
    ! Thus, the values of most variables at thermodynamic level k = 1 are not
    ! often needed or referenced.
    !
    ! For level k = 1:
    !
    ! The formula for a linear extension is given by:
    !
    ! var_zm( extend to zt(k) )
    ! = [ ( var_zm(k+1) - var_zm(k) ) / ( zm(k+1) - zm(k) ) ]
    !     * ( zt(k) - zm(k) ) + var_zm(k);
    !
    ! which can be rewritten as:
    !
    ! var_zm( extend to zt(k) )
    ! = [ ( zt(k) - zm(k) ) / ( zm(k+1) - zm(k) ) ]
    !     * ( var_zm(k+1) - var_zm(k) ) + var_zm(k).
    !
    ! Furthermore, the formula can be rewritten as:
    !
    ! var_zm( extend to zt(k) )
    ! = factor * var_zm(k+1) + ( 1 - factor ) * var_zm(k);
    !
    ! where:
    !
    ! factor = ( zt(k) - zm(k) ) / ( zm(k+1) - zm(k) ).
    !
    ! Due to the fact that a linear extension is being used, the value of factor
    ! will be less than 0.  The weight of the upper momentum level, which is
    ! momentum level k = 2, on thermodynamic level k = 1 equals the value of
    ! factor.  The weight of the lower momentum level, which is momentum level
    ! k = 1, on thermodynamic level k = 1 equals 1 - factor, which is greater
    ! than 1.  However, the sum of the weights equals 1.
