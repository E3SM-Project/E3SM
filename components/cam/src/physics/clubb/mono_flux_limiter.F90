    ! Description:
    ! Limits the value of w'x' and corrects the value of xm when the xm turbulent
    ! advection term is not monotonic.  A monotonic turbulent advection scheme
    ! will not create new extrema for variable x, based only on turbulent
    ! advection (not considering mean advection and xm forcings).
    !
    ! Montonic turbulent advection
    ! ----------------------------
    !
    ! A monotonic turbulent advection scheme does not allow new extrema for
    ! variable x to be created (by means of turbulent advection).  In a
    ! monotonic turbulent advection scheme, when only the effects of turbulent
    ! advection are considered (neglecting forcings and mean advection), the
    ! value of variable x at a given point should not increase above the
    ! greatest value of variable x at nearby points, nor decrease below the
    ! smallest value of variable x at nearby points.  Nearby points are points
    ! that are close enough to the given point so that the value of variable x
    ! at the given point is effected by the values of variable x at the nearby
    ! points by means of transfer by turbulent winds during a time step.  Again,
    ! a monotonic scheme insures that advection only transfers around values of
    ! variable x and does not create new extrema for variable x.  A monotonic
    ! turbulent advection scheme is useful because the turbulent advection term
    ! (w'x') may go numerically unstable, resulting in large instabilities in
    ! the mean field (xm).  A monotonic turbulent advection scheme will limit
    ! the change in xm, and also in w'x'.
    !
    ! The following example illustrates the concept of monotonic turbulent
    ! advection.  Three successive vertical grid levels are shown (k-1, k, and
    ! k+1).  Three point values of theta-l are listed at every vertical grid
    ! level.  All three vertical levels have a mean theta-l (thlm) of 288.0 K.
    ! A circulation is occuring (in the direction of the arrows) in the vertical
    ! (w wind component) and in the horizontal (u and/or v wind components),
    ! such that the mean value of vertical velocity (wmm) is 0, but there is a
    ! turbulent component such that w'^2 > 0.
    !
    ! level = k+1 || --- 287.0 K --- 288.0 K --- 289.0 K --- || thlm = 288.0
    !             ||      / \--------------------->|         ||
    !             ||       |                       |         || wmm = 0; wp2 > 0
    !             ||       |<---------------------\ /        ||
    ! level = k   || --- 288.0 K --- 288.0 K --- 288.0 K --- || thlm = 288.0
    !             ||       |<---------------------/ \        ||
    !             ||       |                       |         || wmm = 0; wp2 > 0
    !             ||      \ /--------------------->|         ||
    ! level = k-1 || --- 287.5 K --- 288.0 K --- 288.5 K --- || thlm = 288.0
    !
    ! Neglecting any contributions from thlm forcings (effects of radiation,
    ! microphysics, large-scale horizontal advection, etc.), the values of
    ! theta-l as shown will be altered by only turbulent advection.  As a side
    ! note, the contribution of mean advection will be 0 since wmm = 0.  The
    ! diagram shows that the value of theta-l at the point on the right at level
    ! k will increase.  However, the values of theta-l at the other two points
    ! at level k will remain the same.  Thus, the value of thlm at level k will
    ! become greater than 288.0 K.  In the same manner, the values of thlm at
    ! the other two vertical levels (k-1 and k+1) will become smaller than
    ! 288.0 K.  However, the monotonic turbulent advection scheme insures that
    ! any theta-l point value cannot become smaller than the smallest theta-l
    ! point value (287.0 K) or larger than the largest theta-l point value
    ! (289.0 K).  Since all theta-l point values must fall between 287.0 K and
    ! 289.0 K, the level averages of theta-l (thlm) must fall between 287.0 K
    ! and 289.0 K.  Thus, any values of the turbulent flux, w'th_l', that would
    ! cause thlm to rise above 289.0 K or fall below 287.0 K, not considering
    ! the effect of other terms on thlm (such as forcings), are faulty and need
    ! to be limited appropriately.  The values of thlm also need to be corrected
    ! appropriately.
    !
    ! Formula for the limitation of w'x' and xm
    ! -----------------------------------------
    !
    ! The equation for change in the mean field, xm, over time is:
    !
    ! d(xm)/dt = -w*d(xm)/dz - (1/rho_ds) * d( rho_ds * w'x' )/dz + xm_forcing;
    !
    ! where w*d(xm)/dz is the mean advection component,
    ! (1/rho_ds) * d( rho_ds * w'x' )/dz is the turbulent advection component,
    ! and xm_forcing is the xm forcing component.  The d(xm)/dt time tendency
    ! component is discretized as:
    !
    ! xm(k,<t+1>)/dt = xm(k,<t>)/dt - w*d(xm)/dz 
    !                  - (1/rho_ds) * d( rho_ds * w'x' )/dz + xm_forcing.
    !
    ! The value of xm after it has been advanced to timestep (t+1) must be in an
    ! appropriate range based on the values of xm at timestep (t), the amount of
    ! xm forcings applied over the ensuing time step, and the amount of mean
    ! advection applied over the ensuing time step.  This is exactly the same
    ! thing as saying that the value of xm(k,<t+1>), with the contribution of
    ! turbulent advection included, must fall into a certain range based on the
    ! value of xm(k,<t+1>) without the contribution of the turbulent advection
    ! component over the last time step.  The following inequality is used to
    ! limit the value of xm(k,<t+1>):
    !
    ! MIN{ xm(k-1,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k-1) - dt*wm_zt(k-1)*d(xm)/dz|_(k-1)
    !         - x_max_dev_low(k-1,<t>),
    !      xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k)
    !         - x_max_dev_low(k,<t>), 
    !      xm(k+1,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k+1) - dt*wm_zt(k+1)*d(xm)/dz|_(k+1)
    !         - x_max_dev_low(k+1,<t>) }
    ! <= xm(k,<t+1>) <=
    ! MAX{ xm(k-1,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k-1) - dt*wm_zt(k-1)*d(xm)/dz|_(k-1)
    !         + x_max_dev_high(k-1,<t>), 
    !      xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k)
    !         + x_max_dev_high(k,<t>), 
    !      xm(k+1,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k+1) - dt*wm_zt(k+1)*d(xm)/dz|_(k+1)
    !         + x_max_dev_high(k+1,<t>) };
    !
    ! where x_max_dev_low is the absolute value of the deviation from the mean
    ! of the smallest point value of variable x at the given vertical level and
    ! timestep; and where x_max_dev_high is the deviation from the mean of the
    ! largest point value of variable x at the given vertical level and
    ! timestep.  For example, at vertical level (k+1) and timestep (t):
    !
    ! x_max_dev_low(k+1,<t>)  = | MIN( x(k+1,<t>) ) - xm(k+1,<t>) |;
    ! x_max_dev_high(k+1,<t>) = MAX( x(k+1,<t>) ) - xm(k+1,<t>).
    !
    ! The inequality shown above only takes into account values from the central
    ! level, one-level-below the central level, and one-level-above the central
    ! level.  This is the minimal amount of vertical levels that can have their
    ! values taken into consideration.  Any vertical level that can have it's
    ! properties advect to the given level during the course of a single time
    ! step can be taken into consideration.  However, only three levels will be
    ! considered in this example for the sake of simplicity.
    !
    ! The inequality will be written in more simple terms:
    !
    ! xm_lower_lim_allowable(k) <= xm(k,<t+1>) <= xm_upper_lim_allowable(k).
    !
    ! The inequality can now be related to the turbulent flux, w'x'(k,<t+1>),
    ! through a substitution that is made for xm(k,<t+1>), such that:
    !
    ! xm(k,<t+1>) = xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k)
    !               - dt * (1/rho_ds) * d( rho_ds * w'x' )/dz|_(k).
    !
    ! The inequality becomes:
    !
    ! xm_lower_lim_allowable(k)
    ! <=
    !    xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k)
    !    - dt * (1/rho_ds) * d( rho_ds * w'x' )/dz|_(k)
    ! <=
    ! xm_upper_lim_allowable(k).
    !
    ! The inequality is rearranged, and the turbulent advection term,
    ! d(w'x')/dz, is discretized:
    !
    ! xm_lower_lim_allowable(k)
    ! - [ xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k) ]
    ! <=
    !    - dt * (1/rho_ds_zt(k))
    !           * invrs_dzt(k)
    !             * [   rho_ds_zm(k) * w'x'(k,<t+1>)
    !                 - rho_ds_zm(k-1) * w'x'(k-1,<t+1>) ]
    ! <=
    ! xm_upper_lim_allowable(k)
    ! - [ xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k) ];
    !
    ! where invrs_dzt(k) = 1 / ( zm(k) - zm(k-1) ).
    !
    ! Multiplying the inequality by -rho_ds_zt(k)/(dz*invrs_dzt(k)):
    !
    ! rho_ds_zt(k)/(dz*invrs_dzt(k))
    ! * [ xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k)
    !     - xm_lower_lim_allowable(k) ]
    ! >=
    !    rho_ds_zm(k) * w'x'(k,<t+1>) - rho_ds_zm(k-1) * w'x'(k-1,<t+1>)
    ! >=
    ! rho_ds_zt(k)/(dz*invrs_dzt(k))
    ! * [ xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k)
    !     - xm_upper_lim_allowable(k) ].
    !
    ! Note:  The inequality symbols have been flipped due to multiplication
    !        involving a (-) sign.
    !
    ! Adding rho_ds_zm(k-1) * w'x'(k-1,<t+1>) to the inequality:
    !
    ! rho_ds_zt(k)/(dz*invrs_dzt(k))
    ! * [ xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k)
    !     - xm_lower_lim_allowable(k) ]
    ! + rho_ds_zm(k-1) * w'x'(k-1,<t+1>)
    ! >= rho_ds_zm(k) * w'x'(k,<t+1>) >=
    ! rho_ds_zt(k)/(dz*invrs_dzt(k))
    ! * [ xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k) 
    !     - xm_upper_lim_allowable(k) ]
    ! + rho_ds_zm(k-1) * w'x'(k-1,<t+1>).
    !
    ! The inequality is then rearranged to be based around w'x'(k,<t+1>):
    !
    ! (1/rho_ds_zm(k))
    ! * [ rho_ds_zt(k)/(dt*invrs_dzt(k)) 
    !     * { xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k)
    !         - xm_lower_lim_allowable(k) }
    !     + rho_ds_zm(k-1) * w'x'(k-1,<t+1>) ]
    ! >=   w'x'(k,<t+1>)   >=
    ! (1/rho_ds_zm(k))
    ! * [ rho_ds_zt(k)/(dt*invrs_dzt(k))
    !     * { xm(k,<t>) + dt*xm_forcing(k) - dt*wm_zt(k)*d(xm)/dz|_(k) 
    !         - xm_upper_lim_allowable(k) }
    !     + rho_ds_zm(k-1) * w'x'(k-1,<t+1>) ].
    !
    ! The values of w'x' are found on the momentum levels, while the values of
    ! xm are found on the thermodynamic levels.  Additionally, the values of
    ! rho_ds_zm are found on the momentum levels, and the values of rho_ds_zt
    ! are found on the thermodynamic levels.  The inequality is applied to
    ! w'x'(k,<t+1>) from vertical levels 2 through the second-highest level
    ! (gr%nz-1).  The value of w'x' at level 1 is a set surface (or lowest
    ! level) flux.  The value of w'x' at the highest level is also a set value,
    ! and therefore is not altered.
    !
    ! Approximating maximum and minimum values of x at any given vertical level
    ! -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    !
    ! The CLUBB code provides means, variances, and covariances for certain
    ! variables at all vertical levels.  However, there is no way to find the
    ! maximum or minimum point value of any variable on any vertical level.
    ! Without that information, x_max_dev_low and x_max_dev_high can't be found,
    ! and the inequality above is useless.  However, there is a way to
    ! approximate the maximum and minimum point values at any given vertical
    ! level.  The maximum and minimum point values can be approximated through
    ! the use of the variance, x'^2.
    !
    ! Just as the mean value of x, which is xm, and the turbulent flux of x,
    ! which is w'x', are known, so is the variance of x, which is x'^2.  The
    ! standard deviation of x is the square root of the variance of x.  The
    ! distribution of x along the horizontal plane (at vertical level k) is
    ! approximated to be the sum of two normal (or Gaussian) distributions.
    ! Most of the values in a normal distribution are found within 2 standard
    ! deviations from the mean.  Thus, the maximum point value of x along the
    ! horizontal plance at any vertical level can be approximated as:
    ! xm + 2*sqrt(x'^2).  Likewise, the minimum value of x along the horizontal
    ! plane at any vertical level can be approximated as:  xm - 2*sqrt(x'^2).
    !
    ! The values of x'^2 are found on the momentum levels.  The values of xm
    ! are found on the thermodynamic levels.  Thus, the values of x'^2 are
    ! interpolated to the thermodynamic levels in order to find the maximum
    ! and minimum point values of variable x.
    !
    ! The one downfall of this method is that instabilities can arise in the
    ! model where unphysically large values of x'^2 are produced.  Thus, this
    ! allows for an unphysically large deviation of xm from its values at the
    ! previous time step due to turbulent advection.  Thus, for purposes of
    ! determining the maximum and minimum point values of x, a upper limit
    ! is placed on x'^2, in order to limit the standard deviation of x.  This
    ! limit is only applied in this subroutine, and is not applied to x'^2
    ! elsewhere in the model code.

    ! Calculates the lowermost and uppermost thermodynamic grid levels that can
    ! effect the base (or central) thermodynamic level through the effects of
    ! turbulent advection over the course of one time step.  This is used as
    ! part of the monotonic turbulent advection scheme.
    !
    ! One method is to use the vertical velocity at each level to determine the
    ! amount of time that it takes to travel across that particular grid level.
    ! The method is to keep on advancing one grid level until either (a) the 
    ! total sum of time taken reaches or exceeds the model time step length,
    ! (b) the top or bottom of the model is reached, or (c) a level is reached
    ! where the vertical velocity component (with turbulence included) is
    ! oriented completely opposite of the direction of travel towards the base
    ! (or central) thermodynamic level.  An example of situation (c) would be,
    ! while starting from a higher altitude and searching downward for all
    ! upward vertical velocity components, encountering a strong downdraft
    ! where the vertical velocity at every single point is oriented downward.
    ! Such a situation would occur when the mean vertical velocity (wm_zm)
    ! exceeds any turbulent component (w') that would be oriented upwards.
    !
    ! Another method is to simply set the thickness (in meters) of the layer
    ! that turbulent advection is allowed to act over, for purposes of the 
    ! monotonic turbulent advection scheme.  The lowermost and uppermost
    ! grid level that can effect the base (or central) thermodynamic level
    ! is computed based on the thickness and altitude of each level.

    ! Description
    ! The values of vertical velocity, along a horizontal plane at any given
    ! vertical level, are not allowed by CLUBB to be uniform.  In other words,
    ! there must be some variance in vertical velocity.  This subroutine
    ! calculates the mean of all values of vertical velocity, at any given
    ! vertical level, that are greater than a certain reference velocity.  This
    ! subroutine also calculates the mean of all values of vertical velocity, at
    ! any given vertical level, that are less than a certain reference velocity.
    ! The reference velocity is usually 0 m/s, in which case this subroutine
    ! calculates the average positive (upward) velocity and the average negative
    ! (downward) velocity.  However, the reference velocity may be other values,
    ! such as wm_zm, which is the overall mean vertical velocity.  If the
    ! reference velocity is wm_zm, this subroutine calculates the average of all
    ! values of w that are on the positive ("upward") side of the mean and the
    ! average of all values of w that are on the negative ("downward") side of
    ! the mean.  These mean positive and negative vertical velocities are useful
    ! in determining how long, on average, it takes a parcel of air, being
    ! driven by subgrid updrafts or downdrafts, to traverse the length of the
    ! vertical grid level.
    !
    ! Method
    ! ------
    !
    ! The CLUBB model uses a joint PDF of vertical velocity, liquid water
    ! potential temperature, and total water mixing ratio to determine subgrid
    ! variability.
    !
    ! The values of vertical velocity, w, along an undefined horizontal plane
    ! at any vertical level, are considered to approximately follow a
    ! distribution that is a mixture of two normal (or Gaussian) distributions.
    ! The values of w that are a part of the 1st normal distribution are
    ! referred to as w_1, and the values of w that are part of the 2nd normal
    ! distribution are referred to as w_2.  Note that these distributions
    ! overlap, and there are many values of w that are found in both w_1 and w_2.
    !
    ! The probability density function (PDF) for w, P(w), is:
    !
    ! P(w) = mixt_frac*P(w_1) + (1-mixt_frac)*P(w_2);
    !
    ! where "mixt_frac" is the weight of the 1st normal distribution, and P(w_1) and
    ! P(w_2) are the equations for the 1st and 2nd normal distributions,
    ! respectively:
    !
    ! P(w_1) = 1 / ( sigma_w_1 * sqrt(2*PI) ) 
    !         * EXP[ -(w_1-mu_w_1)^2 / (2*sigma_w_1^2) ]; and
    !
    ! P(w_2) = 1 / ( sigma_w_2 * sqrt(2*PI) ) 
    !         * EXP[ -(w_2-mu_w_2)^2 / (2*sigma_w_2^2) ].
    !
    ! The mean of the 1st normal distribution is mu_w_1, and the standard
    ! deviation of the 1st normal distribution is sigma_w_1.  The mean of the
    ! 2nd normal distribution is mu_w_2, and the standard deviation of the 2nd
    ! normal distribution is sigma_w_2.
    !
    ! The average value of w, distributed according to the probability
    ! distribution, between limits alpha and beta, is:
    !
    ! <w|_(alpha:beta)> = INT(alpha:beta) w P(w) dw.
    !
    ! The average value of w over a certain domain is used to determine the
    ! average positive and negative (as compared to the reference velocity)
    ! values of w at any vertical level.
    !
    ! Average Negative Vertical Velocity
    ! ----------------------------------
    !
    ! The average of all values of w in the distribution that are below the
    ! reference velocity, w|_ref, is the mean value of w over the domain
    ! -inf <= w <= w|_ref, such that:
    !
    ! <w|_(-inf:w|_ref)> = INT(-inf:w|_ref) w P(w) dw.
    !                    = mixt_frac * INT(-inf:w|_ref) w_1 P(w_1) dw_1
    !                      + (1-mixt_frac) * INT(-inf:w|_ref) w_2 P(w_2) dw_2.
    !
    ! For each normal distribution in the mixture of normal distribution, i
    ! (where "i" can be 1 or 2):
    !
    ! INT(-inf:w|_ref) wi P(wi) dwi =

    !   + mu_wi * (1/2)*[ 1 + erf( (w|_ref-mu_wi) / (sqrt(2)*sigma_wi) ) ];
    !
    ! where mu_wi is the mean of w for the ith normal distribution, sigma_wi is
    ! the standard deviations of w for the ith normal distribution, and erf( )
    ! is the error function.
    !
    ! The mean of all values of w <= w|_ref is:

    !                 *[1 + erf( (w|_ref-mu_w_1) / (sqrt(2)*sigma_w_1) )] }

    !
    ! Special Limitations:
    ! --------------------
    !
    ! A normal distribution has a domain from -inf to inf.  However, the mixture
    ! of normal distributions is an approximation of the distribution of values
    ! of w along a horizontal plane at any given vertical level.  Vertical
    ! velocity, w, has absolute minimum and maximum values (that cannot be
    ! predicted by the PDF).  The absolute maximum and minimum for each normal
    ! distribution is most likely found within 2 or 3 standard deviations of the
    ! mean for the relevant normal distribution.  In other words, for each
    ! normal distribution in the mixture of normal distributions, all the values
    ! of w are found within 2 or 3 standard deviations on both sides of the
    ! mean.  Therefore, if one (or both) of the normal distributions has a mean
    ! that is more than 3 standard deviations away from the reference velocity,
    ! then that entire w distribution is found on ONE side of the reference
    ! velocity.
    !
    ! Therefore:
    !
    ! a) where mu_wi + 3*sigma_wi <= w|_ref:
    !
    !       The entire ith normal distribution of w is on the negative side of
    !       w|_ref; and
    !
    !       INT(-inf:w|_ref) wi P(wi) dwi = mu_wi; and
    !       INT(inf:w|_ref) wi P(wi) dwi = 0.
    !
    ! b) where mu_wi - 3*sigma_wi >= w|_ref:
    !
    !       The entire ith normal distribution of w is on the positive side of
    !       w|_ref; and
    !
    !       INT(-inf:w|_ref) wi P(wi) dwi = 0; and
    !       INT(inf:w|_ref) wi P(wi) dwi = mu_wi.
    !
    ! Note:  A value of 3 standard deviations above and below the mean of the
    !        ith normal distribution was chosen for the approximate maximum and
    !        minimum values of the ith normal distribution because 99.7% of
    !        values in a normal distribution are found within 3 standard
    !        deviations from the mean (compared to 95.4% for 2 standard
    !        deviations).  The value of 3 standard deviations provides for a
    !        reasonable estimate of the absolute maximum and minimum of w, while
    !        covering a great majority of the normal distribution.
