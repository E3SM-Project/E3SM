			PILGRIM Tests and Examples
			--------------------------

This directory contains test programs and examples for the CCM version
of the Parallel Library for Grid Manipulations.  The actually library 
code resides in another location of the CCM baseline. 

These unit and minor integration tests serve to validate PILGRIM, 
but they can also be used as benchmarks: CCM timers have been 
built in.


Tests:
------

	DecompTest:		Tests decomposition creation,
				deletion, permutation in decompmodule.  
				Contains no communication and runs sequentially.

	ParUtilitiesTest:	Tests the basic communication primitives
				from parutilitiesmodule; uses features
				from decompmodule

	GhostTest:		Tests the ghosting primitives in 
				ghostmodule, along with decomposition 
				and communications primitives to perform
				a realistic example of ghosting: defining
				a ghosted region, performing a transfer of
				the ghost region, and testing the result

	RedistributeTest:	Redistributes arrays between various
				decompositions. Tests the redistribution 
				primitives in redistributemodule and 
				indirectly those in parutilities module.



Installation:
-------------

The build procedure is closely integrated with the general CCM
build procedure and uses the corresponding CCM makefiles for the 
LR variant of the model.


	make all	-- Create all test programs.

	make GhostTest	-- Create only GhostTest (DecompTest,
			   ParUtilitiesTest, RedistributeTest)

	make clean	-- clean up
