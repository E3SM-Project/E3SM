Testing FATES cross grid seed dispersal is activated by enabling the
namelist switch option fates_seeddisp_cadence as well as providing reasonable
values to the fates parameter file for the following variables:

fates_seed_dispersal_fraction
fates_seed_dispersal_max_dist
fates_seed_dispersal_pdf_scale
fates_seed_dispersal_pdf_shape

Given that the default fates parameter file has the above variables as unset,
a custom fates parameter file must be supplied to appropriately test this mode.
This testmod itself addresses CTSM issue 2151: https://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM/issues/2151
Note that to avoid exceeding the filename string length maximu, the parameter
file generated on the fly is placed in the $SRCROOT/src/fates/parameter_files
directory.  This may still run into problems is the $SRCROOT string is too long.

The max_dist value will impact the size of the 'neighborhood' of gridcells
that fates will attempt to distribute seeds to.  To limit the neighborhood to
something tractable for a regression test, the user_nl_clm file points to a
specific fates parameter file that was generated to work with a 5x5_amazon
resolution.

The main downside of this method is that this file will require a custom update
for every fates parameter file API update.  Addressing CTSM issue #2126 will alleviate
this issue as it will provide the capability to build the fates parameter file on
the fly which with the appropriate values for this test.
