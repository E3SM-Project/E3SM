! This namelist tests turning all points to 'active'; the point of
! this is to make sure that all points in memory could conceivably
! become active in a dynamic landunit run without causing any
! trouble. This should be tested with a _D test.

! Note that we don't necessarily expect this to work with an initial
! conditions file that wasn't itself generated with all_active =
! .true., so we set finidat = ' ' for this test.

all_active = .true.
finidat = ' '
