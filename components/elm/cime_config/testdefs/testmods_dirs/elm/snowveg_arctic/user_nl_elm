! this test has a parameter file with four new parameters defined for NGEE Arctic IM3
! meant to improve snow-vegetation interactions.
! bendresist -> varies between 0 and 1, represents how much vegetation bends under snow loading
! vegshape -> suggested value 1 (parabolic), but 2 also used previously (Liston and Heimstra, 2011)
! taper -> deadstem height/radius ratio, moved from hardcoded in VegStructUpdateMod to pftvarcon
! stocking -> individual density on landscape (plants/m2), moved from hardcoded in VegStructUpdateMod to pftvarcon
