# FATES

FATES (Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator) is a numerical terrestrial ecosystem model
hat can be utilized as a component with various host land models such as ELM.  It is incorporated as an
external module, the development of which is primarily supported by the Department of Energyâ€™s Office of
Science, through the [Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment - Tropics (NGEE-T) project](https://ngee-tropics.lbl.gov/).

The FATES code is hosted online through a github repository at [https://github.com/NGEET/fates](https://github.com/NGEET/fates).

## Technical Document

The full FATES documentation detailing the scientific underpinnings of the model can be found in the
