CLM build and configure directory and scripts. Scripts to help
you prepare to build CLM as a component within CESM, and setup
a namelist for it. There is also functionality only used for CLM
stand-alone testing to build and run the complete system (in conjuction
with the scripts in the models/lnd/clm/test/system directory).

Important files/directories:

--------- Configure and build scripts
--------- (These scripts are also used by the cpl7 scripts)

configure ---------------- Configure script -- sets up the CPP Macro's needed to be
                           defined to build CLM
  ----- configure --help - Configure help mode -- sends information on all configure options
config_files/config_defaults.xml ----- XML file of defaults for CLM
config_files/config_defaults_*.xml --- XML file of defaults for CLM for a specific site
config_files/config_definition.xml --- XML file definining all CLM configuration items

--------- Scripts to build the namelists
--------- (These scripts are also used by the cpl7 scripts)
build-namelist --- Build the namelists needed

--------- CPL7 Script to create namelist and clm library
clm.cpl7.template ------- Script used by CPL7 scripts to create namelist and the build
                          for CLM as a component of CESM.

--------- Scripts to query namelist defaults
listDefaultNamelist.pl -- List the files needed, for a list of resolutions,
                          to run CLM that are currently NOT on your machine.
                          This file can then be used by 
                            scripts/ccsm_utils/Tools/check_input_data
                          to retreive them from the inputdata repository.
                          Setting up cases with create_newcase also does
                          this -- but only for the exact configuration
                          given. This tries to get all the files need
                          for several different resolutions and configurations
                          at once.
queryDefaultNamelist.pl - Query default namelist for settings of variables
queryDefaultXML.pm ------ Subroutines needed by queryDefaultNamelist.pl script
query-xFail ------------- Queries the xFail file (in unit_testers/xFail/expectedClmTestFails.xml)


--------- Test scripts directory
unit_testers --- Directory of scripts to test scipts in this directory
                 (most notably build-namelist and possibly configure)

---------- XML Files describing namelists in namelist_files
namelist_files/namelist_defaults.xml ------- List of default values for the clm4_5 namelist
namelist_files/namelist_defaults_clm4_5_tools.xml - List of default values for the clm4_5 tools.
namelist_files/namelist_defaults_overall.xml ------ List of default values for overall settings
namelist_files/namelist_defaults_usr_files.xml ---- List of default values for the user-files
namelist_files/namelist_definition.xml ----- Definition of all namelist items for clm4_5
namelist_files/namelist_definition.xsl ------------ Describes how to view the xml file as html
namelist_files/namelist_defaults_drydep.xml ------- List of default values for the dry deposition module.
namelist_files/use_cases -------------------------- Specific configurations that build-namelist uses
