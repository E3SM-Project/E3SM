Naming Convention for CLM use-cases                       Jan/2011

It's important that this naming convention be followed so that the PTCLM.py
utility can parse the use-cases appropriately. The build-namelist script also
checks for conformance with these conventions and won't work for names that
don't follow the convention.

Ending suffix requires one of these endings: _transient, _control or _pd

Transient cases:

   yyyy-yyyy_$rcp$desc_transient (for example 1850-2100_rcp8.5_transient)

   or

   20thC$desc_transient  (means nominal 1850-2000 although some datasets are 1850-2005)

Control cases:

   yyyy$desc_control


Present day options (uses default present-day simulation year -- which right now is 2000):

   $desc_pd

Where

yyyy      = Simulation year (such as 1850 or 2000).
yyyy-yyyy = Range of simulation years to run over (i.e.. 1850-2000).
$rcp      = Representative concentration pathway (rcp) description string
            for future scenarios:
            rcp#.# (for example: rcp8.5, rcp6, rcp4.5, rcp2.6)
            [can be blank for historical cases].
$desc     = Description of anything else -- alpha-numeric.
            Should start with an underscore ("_") if not by itself 
            (for _transient and _control).
