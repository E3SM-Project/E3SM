models/lnd/clm/tools/mksurfdata_map/README    Jan 13, 2012

The routines in this directory create a surface dataset.
The output grid is read in from the input namelist and
can correspond to either a global or regional grid. 

Supported model resolutions are those found in the repository input data directory
   $DIN_LOC_ROOT/lnd/clm2/mappingdata/maps

Surface datasets can either be created for two separate cases
  a) for supported model resolutions
  b) for unsupported (user-specified) model resolutions

The following steps provide a method to create the executable
and generate the surface dataset:

1) > cd src
   > gmake
   By default code compiles optimized so it's reasonably fast. If you want
   to use the debugger, with bounds-checking, and float trapping on do the 
   following:
      gmake OPT=FALSE
   See Also: See the models/lnd/clm/tools/README file for notes about setting
   the path for NetCDF and running with shared-memory parallelism.

2) For supported model resolutions - skip this step

   For unsupported model resolutions - do the following...
   determine the pathname of the model resolution SCRIP grid file 
   
   > cd mkmapdata
   invoke one of the following commands
   (for global resolution)
   > ./mkmapdata.sh -f <scrip grid file full pathname> -res <res> -type global    
   (for regional resolution)        
   > ./mkmapdata.sh -f <scrip grid file full pathname> -res <res> -type regional  
   > cd ../

   note: the mapping files generated in ./mkmapdata will be used to
   generate the surface dataset 
   note: the res argument above (<res>) MUST be identical to the one provided to
   mksurfdata.pl (see below)	

3) make surface dataset(s)
   > mksurfdata.pl --help  (for full usage instructions)
   For supported model resolution (<res>)
   > mksurfdata.pl -res <res> [options]	

   For unsupported, user specified model resolutions	
   > mksurfdata.pl -res usrspec -usr_gname <res> -usr_gdate <user grid date>

   Note that the argument to usr_gname MUST be the same as the -res argument value
   when invoking mkmapdata

   Example, for gridname=1x1_boulderCO with maps created on Jan/13/2012

   > mksurfdata.pl -res usrspec -usr_gname 1x_boulderCO -usr_gdate 20120113

 the future scenarios 2006-2100 are the scenario datasets)
