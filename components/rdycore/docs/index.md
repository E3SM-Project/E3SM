# Overview

RDycore is a performance-portable, GPU-capable river model used to study
compound flooding, intended for use with the Department of Energy's [Energy
Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)](https://e3sm.org).

* The [Installation Guide](common/installation.md) shows you how to build and install
  RDycore on your own machine or on a supported high-performance platform.
* The [User Guide](user/index.md) describes how to use RDycore in its standalone and
  E3SM-integrated forms.
* The [Developer Guide](developer/index.md) lays out some basic principles and
  guidelines we use in developing RDycore.
