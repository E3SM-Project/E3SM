This testdef is used to test the conservation check analysis member, which
wasintroduced in MPAS-Ocean PR #4521 and has been made a stealth feature in
#6643. This test turns on the consevation check analysis member by setting:

    config_AM_conservationCheck_enable = .true.

However, it should be noted that MPAS-Ocean history files are not currently
included in E3SM testing so non-BFB results will not be detected.
