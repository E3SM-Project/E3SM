This testdef is used to test a stealth feature that enables coupling between
OCN and GLC for Greenland, which passes ocean thermal forcing from OCN to GLC
and uses that in a parameterization for marine melting of grounded vertical
cliffs.

It changes one mpaso namelist variable,
    config_glc_thermal_forcing_coupling_mode
from its default value to '2d'.
This tests the ocn/glc TF coupling.

It also specified that DATM forcing should be restricted to 1958.
This allows JRA1p5 forcing to be used without a large input data requirement.
