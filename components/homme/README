This it he High Order Method Modeling Environment (HOMME) used by
the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) 

MT 2017/10/7   First version of this README

The HOMME software distributed with E3SM includes the dycores used by
the E3SM model, standalone drivers for these dycores, and a version
for the 2D shallow water equations.  

The source code for the common infrastructure for all models is in
homme/src/share.  The CMake and source code specifc to each model is in
homme/src/<model_name>

The 2D models:  

src/sweqx   spectral element shallow water equations
src/swim    fully implicit version of sweqx

The 2D model can run a veriaty of shallow water test cases and prescribed
velocity tracer transport test cases. The shallow water test can be run
with "nlev" vertical layers, with no coupling between the layers.  
The transport test cases are solved within the shallow water system by 
treating the height field as a tracer, with each vertical layer advecting
a different test tracer.

The 3D models:

src/preqx        original hydrostatic primitive equation model
src/preqx_acc    preqx with openACC acceleration
src/prim         Fully implicit version of preqx
src/theta-l      nonhydrostatic model with SB81 vertical discretization

For instructions on building and configuring, see README.cmake

HOMME has a large regression test suite.  For instructions on running and adding
new tests, see homme/test/reg_test/README


================================================================================
MultiModel Framework
================================================================================

The multimodel framework defines a standard interface for each 3D model and
uses a Fortran module based inheritance system.  

Each model needs to provide:

element_state.F90             Three model specific strucs in the "elem" struct:
                              state variables, derived variables, and diagnostics

element_ops.F90               Interface routines for accessing the elem struct, 
                              including various getter, setter and initialization
                              routines

prim_advance_mod.F90          Code to take a single dycore step

prim_state_mod.F90            stdout diagnostics


Inheritence Model:

In addition to the interface routines defined above, models need to
provide several base class wrapper modules.

All files of the form "_base.F90" are considered base classes.  If a model
will use the routines in these base classes, it should create a wrapper function
of the same name, but with the _mod extension. All source code accesses routines
in these classes through these wrapper modules.

As an example: 

src/share/edge_mod_base.F90      Element edge pack and unpack routines
src/sweqx/edge_mod.F90           interface only code
src/preqx/edge_mod.F90           interface only code
src/preqx_acc/edge_mod.F90       openACC versions of some routines

To use the routines in the base class unchanged, the wrapper
module contains only interface related statements.  To replace a
routine with a version specific to that particular model, the new code
is included in the wrapper module.

Current list of base classses:

These are base classes only so src/preqx_acc can provide openACC versions
  src/share/bndry_mod_base.F90          Boundary exchange
  src/share/edge_mod_base.F90           Element boundary pack/unpack routines
  src/share/derivative_mod_base.F90     Local element derivatives
  src/share/viscosity_base.F90          biharmonic and other global derivatives

src/share/prim_driver_base.F90        All SB81 models use this unchanged

src/share/prim_advection_base.F90     Eulerian 3D advection code
                                      src/preqx_acc has openACC version
                                      src/prex has a experimental semi-lagrange version

src/share/vertremap_base.F90          Vertical remap low level routines
                                      Each model inherits this and adds a routine
                                      to remap all its state variables

src/preqx/share/viscosity_preqx_base.F90  hyper-viscosity shared by preqx, preqx_acc
