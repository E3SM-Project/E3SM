Passive 3d advection with prescribed winds.

Velocities reversed at the midpoint, returning tracers to initial position.
Wind velocities prescribed. Dynamic updates of v, T, p disabled. 

Test 1-1: 3D Deformational Flow

Five tracer fields transported simultaneously:

1. q1 = two cosine bells
2. q2 = inverse squared cosine bells
3. q3 = a slotted ellipse
4. q4 = 1 - 0.3(q1+q2+q3)
5. q5 = 1

test resolution: 
1 degree horizontal, 60 uniformly-spaced vertical levels, duration 12 days
