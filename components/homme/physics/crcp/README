CRCP Standalone test package
----------------------------

9/26/04: the directory was moved into the homme model
         a standalone version can still be built using the 
         Makefile in this directory JPE

This directory contains a standalone version of the CRCP
BL model by W. Grabowski (grabow@ncar.ucar.edu).

The original source is contained in the single file crcp.F
in modified form.  The modifications include replacing the
random number generator, and removing graphics subroutine
calls, and various portability modifications.

The single file source was split into files for each routine 
using the fsplit utility.  The Makefile will compile the split
source.

The test program will run the model for one day, reporting diagnostics
to the terminal.  Also, a history time series is written to unit 17.

The included program in norm.F will compare two history time series
from units 16 and 17.  Thus, to make a comparison, run a baseline (*)
with the model and mv the unit 17 file to unit 16 (e.g. mv fort.17 fort.16)
then run a modified experiment and then run the norm program to compare
the results.  The norm program computes absolute l_2 and l_infinity
norms of all of the fields saved to the history file for each time slice.
Also, one can compare the global diagnostic quantities written to the terminal.

(*) included are: "baseline" a copy the output from a correct run along with
                  "fort.16" the binary history file (powerpc, xlf 8.1)
