Jablonowski and Williamson Baroclinic Instability Test

This test is the same as the baroclinic instability test in
homme/test/jw_baroclnic except that is uses the actual test code
from Jablonowski and advects 4 tracers.

It is a good test of advection schemes in HOMME

See "run.job" for a sample run script.  That script was used with
NE=30, NPTS=4, hyperviscoity 9.6e14 to create the sample plots included 
here.  The plots are created with the Q.ncl script.
Make sure the interpolation grid is at least 256x512.

Tracers 1,2 and 3 at day 9 are plotted.  The 4'th tracer is Q=1 which
tests if tracer advection is consistent with mass advection.
