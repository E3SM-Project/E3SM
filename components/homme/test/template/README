The homme/test/template directory contains utility programs that
involve running standalone HOMME for 1 timestep in order to output
grid and topography information.

There are currently two utility programs:

1) makegrid.job:   
script to generate grid template files, SCRIP and latlon format.
It can only handle cubed-sphere grids with the Gnomonic reference 
element map.  For newer local-element reference map and RRM grids,
one must use a different tool chain.  

2) smoothtopo.job:
Read in topographic data and apply dycore dependent smoothing.

To evaluate the smoothing, use the NCL script topospectral.ncl to compare
contour plots of the topography as well as the energy spectra.  The energy
spectra should show good agreement between the original(unsmoothed) topography
and the smoothed topography at low wave numbers, and the smoothed topography
should have lower energy at high wavenumbers.  The NCL script will print out
the wave number at which the smoothing has reduced the energy by 50%

To run the script, the original and smoothed data sets must first be
interpolated to a latlon grid.  This can be done with ncremap:

ncremap -v PHIS -m /homes/ccsm-data/mapping/maps/map_ne30np4_to_fv257x512_bilin.20150901.nc  \
   /lcrc/group/acme/taylorm/topodata/USGS-gtopo30_ne30np4.nc \
   USGS-gtopo30_ne30np4_latlon.nc

then edit topospectra.ncl to specify the correct filenames before running with NCL.
