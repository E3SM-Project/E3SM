# Apply these testmods to multi-instance tests, too (assuming there are only two instances)
#
# Doing this copy rather than explicitly including user_nl_cism_0001, etc. is
# preferable both to avoid duplication and also so that the FINAL version of
# user_nl_cism is copied in the case that there is another testmods directory
# that includes this one.
#
# Ideally, these copies would be done automatically when applying testmods in
# create_newcase.
cp user_nl_cism user_nl_cism_0001
