This directory contains files needed to build the simple_bisicles prototype
driver.  Simple_bisicles connects CISM to the BISICLES external dynamic core.
Building BISICLES requires access to the BISICLES and Chombo installations.
For more information on BISICLES and Chombo, please send email to
dfmartin@lbl.gov or ranken@lanl.gov.

The build_simple_bisicles file is a script that can be used to build
simple_bisicles, and also shows the 4 steps of the build process.  The paths
in this script may need modification.

A test of simple_bisicles specific to hopper.nersc.gov can be found in
tests/dome.

For a description of BISICLES, see:
