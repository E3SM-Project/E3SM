# Documentation of options for cmake configuration of glimmer-cism.
# Ordered roughly by importance/frequency of use. 
#
#Cmake variables starting with GLIMMER are ones I invented for use
# in CMakeLists.txt, and can be freely added and used. The intention
# is for this documentation to be a complete list.
#
#Cmake variables starting with CMAKE_ are known by CMake
# buils system, and have their own meaning and defaults.
# Here I document ones that we commonly will set, but there
# are many more.

% Path to Trilinos installation (currenlty REQUIRED)
-D GLIMMER_TRILINOS_DIR=/ccs/proj/cli054/trilinos-10.10.1/GCC_BUILD/include \

%Path to netcdf install: expects "include" and "lib" subdirs (currently REQUIRED)
-D GLIMMER_NETCDF_DIR=$NETCDF_DIR \

%List of name(s) of netcdf libraries. Defaults to "netcdff;netcdf"
% where "netcdf" is the other common option.
-D GLIMMER_NETCDF_LIBS="netcdf" \

% Option to add additional library to beginning of link line. This
% is needed for PGI builds where we link with C++ but have a 
% main() in Fortran.
-D GLIMMER_FMAIN="/opt/pgi/11.10.0/linux86-64/11.10/lib/f90main.o" \

% CMake variables to specify compiler flags. The default is to get
% these from the Trilinos build. Setting these will overwrite the 
% values from Trilinos. (See following set of options.)
-D CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS="-g -O2" \
-D CMAKE_C_FLAGS="-g -O2" \
-D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-g -O2" \

% Variables to addend to compiler flags. These are appended to the
% CMAKE_* versions above, and allow us to take the flags used in
% Trilinos and add to them.
-D GLIMMER_Fortran_FLAGS="-ffree-line-length-none" \
-D GLIMMER_C_FLAGS="" \
-D GLIMMER_CXX_FLAGS="-DMY_SPECIAL_DEFINE" \

% CMake variable to toggle (ON,OFF) verbosity of output when running make.
-D CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=OFF \ 

% Option to just build glimmercism libraries and not simple_glided executable.
% Defaults of OFF.
-D GLIMMER_NO_EXECUTABLE=ON \ 

% CMake variables to specify compilers. Currently these are obtained
% from the Trilinos build and not set here. These may be set by CESM later.
