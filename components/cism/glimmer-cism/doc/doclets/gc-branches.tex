\maketitle

2010 will be an exciting year for Glimmer-CISM development. We plan to make a release of the model with the higher order physics included. There are also plans for a major refactoring effort to make the ice sheet model more modular.

\end{figure}

The diagram above illustrates the relationship among various existing branches and branches to be created. We have the following plans:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf April 2010} merge Bill's changes on the GC2-gcm branch into GC2-trunk and make a GC-1.6 release. This series of stable releases will be integrated into CCSM.
\item {\bf End of April 2010} merge GC-lanl-trunk into GC2-trunk and make a GC-1.8 release. This series of stable releases will contain the higher order physics but no parallelisation
\item {\bf Summer 2010} finish refactoring of shallow ice glimmer and merge GC2-refactoring into GC2-trunk. 
\item refactor higher order parts of Glimmer-CISM. Once ready make GC-2.0 release.
\item create new GC2-parallel branch and merge in differences between GC-lanl-parallel and GC-lanl-trunk. The parallel branches will remain private for now.
\end{enumerate}
