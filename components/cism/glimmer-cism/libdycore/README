The libdycore directory contains routines that allow CISM to be connected to
external dynamic cores written in C++.  Currently, an interface to the
BISICLES dycore is being developed.  A prototype driver that uses the BISICLES
dycore can be found in example-drivers/simple_bisicles/src.  Build instructions
are located in that directory.  A typical build of the BISICLES/libDyCoreToGlimmer.a
library can be performed using run_make.  Building BISICLES requires access to the
BISICLES and Chombo installations.  For more information on BISICLES and Chombo,
please send email to dfmartin@lbl.gov or ranken@lanl.gov.  Some additional information
can also be found in glimmer_to_dycore.info, though this file is out-of-date.

For a description of BISICLES, see:
