The seacism/builds directory is intended to contain cmake builds of CISM for the
most common platform/compiler-suite combinations.  Each subdirectory of this
directory should contain a README file and a configure script file whose name
is <directory name>-cmake, for example, hopper-pgi-cmake.  The README
file should contain instructions to do the build, provide information on what
compiler suite will be used, and list what executables will be built, e.g.
simple_glide and simple_bisicles.  It should also list any dependencies on 
other packages.  These dependencies should be handled in the configure script.

The difference between this and using the cmake-scripts directory is that these
builds should be even more out-of-the box, so that a user can cd to the
appropriate directory, read the brief README file, and be able to quickly
generate the CISM build.  The cmake scripts in the build directories should
handle loading the appropriate modules as part of simplifying the build
process, and should be kept current as much as possible.  A significant part
of that is making sure the installed packages that the build relies on are
current.  As an example, the packages that need to be maintained for the
hopper-pgi build are Trilinos and BISICLES (which also includes Chombo).
