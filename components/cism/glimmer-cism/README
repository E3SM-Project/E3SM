===================

Glimmer-CISM is a land ice model designed to be used as part of 
an earth-system model or stand-alone model. Full documentation can 
be found in the doc directory. 

Licensing:
=========

Glimmer-CISM is issued under the GNU General Public Licence. 
See LICENCE in the main directory.

Note that this licence DOES NOT APPLY to the SLAP linear algebra library, 
which is contained in its own directory, and is in the public domain.

Mailing list
============
There are two mailing lists:
1. the general user mailing list

Bugs:
====

Please send all bug reports (preferably with fixes!) to the glimmer mailing list:
glimmer-cism-devel@lists.berlios.de

Compiling:
=========

The model should build reasonably straightforwardly using make. 
Additional notes are provided in COMPILE in the main directory.

Documentation
=============
The doc directory contains the LaTeX sources for the documentation. When
configuring the build system you can enable the documentation build by
supplying the --enable-doc-pdf and/or --enable-doc-ps. If you have doxygen
installed you can build the API documentation by running make doxygen-doc
in the doc directory.

Running make www will produce a tar ball containing html versions of the
manual and the API documentation.
