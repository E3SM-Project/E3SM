Notes about config.inc.cmake.in:

Autoconf generated a config.inc file with lots of defines.
This file is an attempt to hardwire the required defines and
just rename this file config.inc at cmake configuration time.
Not sure if it will work to have it machine independent. Andy 6/2012

FC_FUNC_: As FC_FUNC, but for C identifiers containing underscores.
