This is an exerpt from a PISM README file downloaded from
http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/pism/trunk/examples/eisross/
describing the riggs_clean.dat file

riggs_data_edit_fromDM.txt (=FILE1):  This text file was sent to 
Ed Bueler (=ELB) by Doug MacAyeal on 19 Dec 2006.  It seems to 
contain the (global) latitude and longitude of the 149 locations 
of RIGGS data which were actually used to compute the \chi^2 measure.

riggs_clean.dat:  This text file is a modified version
of the previous file.  ELB removed some clutter to make it 
machine-readable, and included the latitude and longitude from the 
above file.  The RIGGS grid system is clearly described in Table A1, 
Part 1 of R. Thomas and three others, "Glaciological Studies on the 
Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica, 1973-1978", Antarctica Research Series 
Volume 42, American Geophysical Union 1984.  (Unfortunately the
grid system has been destroyed in the file "RIGGS.dat".)  The 
obviously spurious point "N16" in the RIGGS data has been thrown out;
note that Figure 11 in (Thomas et al 1984) does not contain it either. 
There are 14 columns in this file:
COLUMN    MEANING
1         index of point used in FILE1
2         north latitude (i.e. actual latitude) from FILE1
3         west longitude from FILE1
4         degrees grid south latitude
                     (table A1, part 1 in Thomas et al 1984)
5         minutes grid south latitude  (")
6         seconds grid south latitude  (")
7         degrees grid east*OR*west longitude  (")
8         minutes grid east*OR*west longitude  (")
9         seconds grid east*OR*west longitude  (")
10        +1 if west, -1 if east (regards columns 7,8,9)  (")
11        speed (m/a) at point
12        *geographic* bearing at point
13        grid bearing at point
                     (table A1, part 2 in Thomas et al 1984)
14        estimated speed error (m/a; note replaced with 30
          for Chi^2 stat in MacAyeal et al 1996)
