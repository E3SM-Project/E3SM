List of commonly encountered problems:

    except OSError as o:
                    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

2. Wrong configure path or name given in VV_testsuite:

  File "/global/scratch/sd/evanskj/cism_tests/livv/bin/VV_main.py", line 274, in <module>
    options.test_suite,options.ncl_path,target_html)
