INPUT DATA:

To run this glint-example test case, you will need to download the following climate files:

* ncep-doe_6h_climate.64x32.nc (precip and 2-m temp on a global grid)

* orog.igcmgrid.64x32.nc (surface elevation on a global grid)

You will also need a 20-km Greenland input file:

* gland20.input.nc

These three netCDF files are part of a tar file, glint-example.1.0.0.tar.gz,
that can be downloaded from the BerliOS repository:

     http://developer.berlios.de/projects/glimmer-cism/

These files are also available in the CESM inputdata repository, here:
https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/glc/cism/gland20.input.nc
and:
https://svn-ccsm-inputdata.cgd.ucar.edu/trunk/inputdata/glc/cism/glint_example/

To run a 5-km Greenland test case, you will need to download one of the files here:

     http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/Present_Day_Greenland

The default is Greenland_5km_v1.1.nc. This file is also available in the CESM inputdata repo.

The 5-km test case and 20-km test case use the same climate files.


BUILDING AND RUNNING THE TEST CASES:

When building the code, make sure to create the executable glint_example.
As of August 2013, this executable lives in main_cism_directory/example_drivers/glint/src.

Then copy or link the executable to this test directory.
(E.g., ln -s ../../example-drivers/glint/src/glint_example glint_example)

As of August 2013, the repo contains three Greenland config files:
(1) greenland_20km.config
(2) greenland_5km.config
(3) greenland_20km.config.smb

These files have settings that are physically reasonable but not scientifically validated.

Files (1) and (2) are basically identical except for the grid resolution and timestep.
Both these files use the native Glint positive-degree-day (PDD) scheme to force the Glide dycore,
which uses the shallow-ice approximation.

Files (1) and (3) are identical except that file (3) has acab_mode = 0, which means
that Glint uses an externally computed surface mass balance (SMB) instead of computing
the SMB with a PDD scheme.  Normally the SMB would be computed and passed in by a climate 
model such as CESM.  But for the standalone code, the SMB is estimated crudely based on
the input temperature and precip fields.  This allows us to test the Glint interfaces
that would be called by a climate model, without actually coupling to a climate model.

There are two glint_example config files in the repo:
(1) glint_example.config
(2) glint_example.config.smb

These files are set up to use the global NCEP climatological data for downscaling to
the Greenland grid. These files also set the length of the model run (by default, we run
a 10-year smoke test).  The only difference is that file (1) should be run with the
PDD scheme and file (2) with the SMB scheme.

The three standard diagnostic tests in this directory can be launched as follows:

* ./glint_example greenland_20km.config glint_example.config
* ./glint_example greenland_5km.config glint_example.config 
* ./glint_example greenland_20km.config.smb glint_example.config.smb

These are currently the only standard tests that exercise the Glint part of the code,
which is required for coupling to a climate model.

Diagnostic output is written to a file called greenland_20km.config.log
or something similar.  NetCDF output is written to various files at a frequency
set in the Greenland config file.
