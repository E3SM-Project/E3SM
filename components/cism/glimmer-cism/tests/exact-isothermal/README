Introduction
------------
This module contains a f95 implementation of the exact solutions for 
isothermal ice sheet models developed by Ed Bueler et al [1]. The f95 code
is based on their matlab code which is included in this module with their 
agreement.

Compilation
-----------
./configure --with-glimmer-prefix=DIR_WHERE_GLIMMER_IS_INSTALLED
make

Running the Test Suite
----------------------
Running the entire test suite for all resolutions takes quite some time. If 
you are willing to wait you can just run
make png
in the tests directory. Alternatively, you can run individual tests using the
run_verif.py script. Run "run_verif.py -h" for a list of options.

Licensing
---------
The code is licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. A copy of the GPL
is included in this module. See the file COPYING.
