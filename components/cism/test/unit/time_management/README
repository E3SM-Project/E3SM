This directory contains code for testing the glc time manager.

To build the test program, run the following from this directory:

  gmake OPT=FALSE

This will create the time_management_test program.

To run the program:

First copy a set of inputs to this directory; for example:

  cp inputs/oneyear/*_in .

Then modify cism_in and time_management_test_in, if desired

Then run:

  ./time_management_test > test_output

You can then examine the output and/or compare it to output from a
previous version of the code.


--- NOTES ABOUT RESTART TESTS ---

For some cases, there are three similar directories in the inputs
directory: <testname>, <testname>.restart1, and <testname>.restart2.

These sets of directories are for doing restart tests, to make sure
that the sequence of times is the same for (a) a run that goes all the
way through, and (b) the same run broken up into two pieces.

To run the restart test, do:

  restart_test testname

If the test succeeds (i.e., the restart case gives the same time
sequence as the run all the way through), then there will be no output
from this script. If there are some differences, these differences
will be output to stdout.

For regression testing, you should test <testname> and
<testname>.restart2, but it is not necessary to test
<testname>.restart1, since that just gives a subset of the run done by
<testname>. (Note that you can run <testname>.restart2 without running
<testname>.restart1 -- for this time management test driver, a restart
file is not necessary -- it just simulates what would happen if there
were a restart file.)


--- TEST LISTS ---

testlist: list of tests in the 'inputs' directory that should be run
for complete regression testing

restart_testlist: list of tests that should be run with 'restart_test'
