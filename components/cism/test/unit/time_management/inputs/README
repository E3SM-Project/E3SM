This directory contains inputs for the time_management test driver for
a number of test cases.

To run with a given set of inputs, copy the files in one of the
sub-directories to the parent time_management directory.

For example, to run the oneyear test, do the following:

  cp oneyear/*_in ..
  cd ..
  ./time_management_test > oneyear_output


--- NOTE ABOUT DIRECTORIES WITH NAME FAIL_* ---

Directories with the name *_FAIL (or *_FAIL_restart1 and
*_FAIL_restart2) are expected to fail. For example, these are used to
make sure that the restart_test script successfully catches failures
to restart exactly.

--- DOCUMENTATION OF INPUTS CONTAINED HERE ---

Tests that should fail:

- FAIL_oneday_1, FAIL_oneday_1.restart1, FAIL_oneday_1.restart2:
  Restart test with one-day time step expected to fail

- FAIL_oneday_2, FAIL_oneday_2.restart1, FAIL_oneday_2.restart2:
  Restart test with one-day time step expected to fail


Tests that should succeed:

The following is generally ordered from short to long time steps:

- sixhour: Test 6-hour time step

- sixhour.restart1: Test six-hour time step with restart: first
  portion of run. Note that this stops in the middle of a year.

- sixhour.restart2: Test six-hour time step with restart: second
  portion of run.

- sixhour_leap: Test 6-hour time step, with leap years

- sevenhour: Test 7-hour time step, for the sake of testing a time step
  that doesn't divide a day

- oneday: Test one-day time step

- oneday.restart1: Test one-day time step with restart: first portion
  of run

- oneday.restart2: Test one-day time step with restart: second portion
  of run

- oneday_leap: Test one-day time step, with leap years

- 20day_leap_start00031225: Short run starting near the end of a year,
  where first time step brings us to the next year

- 20day_leap_start00041225: Similar to 20day_leap_start00031225, but
  now starting in a leap year

- 20day_forRestart_stopEndOfYear,
  20day_forRestart_stopEndOfYear.restart1,
  20day_forRestart_stopEndOfYear.restart2: Restart test with a run
  with a 20-day timestep, where the first run of the restart test
  stops at the end of the year, so the first timestep of the continue
  case crosses a year boundary. 

- 20day_forRestart_stopEndOfYear_leap,
  20day_forRestart_stopEndOfYear_leap.restart1,
  20day_forRestart_stopEndOfYear_leap.restart2: Similar to
  20day_forRestart_stopEndOfYear, but with leap years active.

- 100day_leap_start00031225: Short run starting near the end of a
  year, where first time step brings us to the next year and crosses
  the Feb 29 border

- 100day_leap_start00041225: Similar to 100day_leap_start00031225, but
  now starting in a leap year

- 219day: Test with 219-day time step, for the sake of testing a time
  step that doesn't divide a year (but divides 5 years)

- 219day_leap: Test with 219-day time step, with leap years

- oneyear: Test one-year time step

- oneyear.restart1: Test one-year time step with restart: first
portion of run

- oneyear.restart2: Test one-year time step with restart: second
portion of run

- oneyear_leap: Test 365-day time step, with leap years

- 511day: Test with 511-day time step, for the sake of testing a time
  step greater than a year, but not an exact number of years (but note
  that 5 timesteps = 7 years)

- 511day_leap: Test with 511-day time step, with leap years

- twoyear: Test 2-year time step, specified as 0.5 steps_per_year
  (purpose is to test fractional steps_per_year)

- twoyear.restart1: Test 2-year time step with restart: first portion
  of run

- twoyear.restart2: Test 2-year time step with restart: second portion
  of run

- threeyear: Test 3-year time step

- threeyear_leap: Test 1095-day time step, with leap years
