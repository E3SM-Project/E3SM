The Parallel IO libraries (PIO) are high-level parallel I/O C and
Fortran libraries for structured grid applications. PIO provides a
netCDF-like API, and allows users to designate some subset of
processors to perform IO. Computational code calls netCDF-like
functions to read and write data, and PIO uses the IO processors to
perform all necessary IO.

PIO also supports the creation of multiple computation components,
each containing many processors, and one shared set of IO
processors. The computational components can perform write operation
asynchronously, and the IO processors will take care of all storage
interaction.

This user's guide provides information about the PIO library and
examples on how it can be used. Please watch the PIO GitHub site
[https://github.com/NCAR/ParallelIO] for announcements and new
releases.
