We need to create a set of "official" regression tests.
Here we are documenting the test cases in use at Sandia 
as unofficial regression tests.

These tests should be run in both the trunk and your branch
to ensure changes you have made have not broken existing code.
To check for bit-for-bit (BFB), output should be identical. To
check for rounding-error level changes, several statistics are
highlighted.

There are a couple of short BFB tests and an exact restart test
that should be sufficient for changes to the 3D code that are
BFB.  Non-BFB changes require verifing minimal changes in l2
solution errors,conservation errors, energy budget errors, and
checking plots of the vorticity field and and tracers.

Each script uses the build system in build/ to compile and runs
with an appropriate namelist, but none are queue-ready on any
machine at this time. They can be launched individually through
the individual_tests/ directory, or you can run all of them
(except baro-dg, because it takes significantly longer to run)
with the alltests.sh script. Again, these can only be run
interactively at the moment.


Components tested:

shallow water equations:
   explicit leapfrog    
   explicit Runge-Kutta 
   sign-preserving limiter
   hyperviscosity
   conservation (inviscid)
   PIO_INTERP output

primitive equations:
   explicit leapfrog
   RK w/ subcycling
   semi-implicit
   viscosity
   hyper-viscosity
   conservation (inviscid)
   conservation (with hyper-viscosity)
   RK-SSP tracer advection
   exact restart
   PIO and PIO_INTERP output

3D PRIMITIVIE EQUATION TESTS -- DETAILS

baro1a.sh   Test case from Polvani et al 2004
            Spectral Element core
            Explicit leapfrog + viscosity
            Output using PIO_INTERP
            NE=9, NP=8, PLEV=20, dt=60
            Run the configuration in this script, visually
            compare plots produced in baro1a.pdf (either
            run in branch AND trunk or compare to plots in
            baro1a-ref.pdf in this directory)

baro1b.sh   Test case from Polvani et al 2004
            Spectral Element core
            Semi-implicit time-stepping
            Output using PIO
            NE=9, NP=8, PLEV=20, dt=600
            Run the configuration in this script, visually
            compare plots produced in baro1b.pdf (either
            run in branch AND trunk or compare to plots in
            baro1b-ref.pdf in this directory)

            Verification: baro1[ab].sh 
            run both tests, verify enstrophy norm has not changed significantly
            (2-3 digits).  Plot vorticity with the NCL script provided and
            compare with reference plots provided.  Plots should be 
           visually identical.


baro2a.sh   Test case from Jablonowski and Williamson 2006
            Spectral Element core
            No tracers
            Explicit leapfrog + hyperviscosity
            Output using PIO_INTERP
            NE=15, NP=4, PLEV=26, dt=180

            NOTE: tracer advection with leapfrog dynamics
                  no longer supported. Need to update 
                  reference plots to look at vorticty
                  instead of tracers. (MT 2012/10)

            Verification:
            Run the configuration in this script, visually
            compare plots produced in q.pdf (either run
            in branch AND trunk or compare to plots in
            baro2a-ref.pdf in this directory)

            l2 error in PS against T340 EUL result
            l2 PS error at day 9:  1.13mb
            plot PS, zeta, compare with reference plots.  


baro2c.sh   first runs 9 days of the JW baroclinic test case (to get to an
            interesting flow field).  Then do a short restart run
            with a very small timestep to measure mass and energy
            conservation.  IE dissipation should be very small.
            KE dissipation should be matched by heating term, resulting
            in very small total energy dissipation.

            Verification:  mass and tracer mass conservation to machine precision.
            verify IE,KE balance to machine precision
            verify tracer variance dissipation has not changed significantly  
            This script will make two runs: run1: 9 days and writes a restart file
            run2: restarts from this file and runs 3 timesteps.       
            Example output from last timstep of run2:

            This test is still very noisy, so these numbers should be
            updated when the test works :) But for now, verify final
