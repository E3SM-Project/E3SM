This document describes the format of a run_config file, which is used to
define an environment to run the model in.

A run_config file will describe the steps that convert a line of <model_run>
from a run_script (defined in a config file) into an execution of the model.

Below is a description of the XML tags available within a run_config file:

<run_config> - The parent tag of a run_config file. This is used to define a
               run_config definition.
    - Children:
        * <define_env_var>
        * <step>

<define_env_var> - This tag is used to specify the definition of an environment
                   variable. For example, OMP_NUM_THREADS.
    - Attributes:
        * name: This attribute defines the name of the environment variable
                that will be set.
        * value: This attribute defines the value that will be given to the
                 environment variable. This attribute can take the value
                 attr_{name} to use the value of the attribute in the
                 <model_run> tag that is generating the model run, rather than
                 having it's value hard coded.

<step> - This tag defines a step in a run script
    - Attributes:
        * executable: The base executable for this step of the run script. e.g. mpirun
        * executable_name: The name of the executable that has been defined in
                           the configuration file to be used for this step of the run script.
    - Children:
        * <argument>

<argument> - This tag defines arguments for the executable in a specific step of
             a run script.
    - Attributes:
        * flag: A flag that will come before the argument. e.g. -n
    - Text:
        * The text between the <argument> and </argument> tags will be used as
          the argument after the flag. In the example "mpirun -n 4" the flag
          would be -n, and the text would be 4.
          Additionally, the text of this tag can take the following keyword values:
            - model: Use the model executable in place of an actual argument
            - attr_{name}: Use the attribute of the <model_run> tag that
                           generates a model run named {name} for the value.

Examples:

As an example, suppose a case for the test core had the following <model_run> tag:

<model_run procs="1" threads="1" namelist="namelist.test" streams="streams.test"/>

And you wanted this to produce a set of lines that looked like:

export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
mpirun -n 1 ./test_model -n namelist.test -s streams.test

A <run_config> file would look as follows for this:

<run_config>
    <define_env_var name="OMP_NUM_THREADS" value="attr_threads"/>
    <step executable="mpirun">
        <argument flag="-n">attr_procs</argument>
        <argument flag="">model</argument>
        <argument flag="-n">attr_namelist</argument>
        <argument flag="-s">attr_streams</argument>
    </step>
</run_config>
