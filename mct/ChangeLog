One-line Summary:  Bug fix for memory leak

Purpose of changes:
Subroutine initv_ was modified to add a string clean
(as shown below) in order to fix a significant memory
leak problem in ccsm.

  if(associated(bv%iList%bf)) then  
     call String_clean(iLStr)       
  endif                             
  if(associated(bv%rList%bf)) then  
     call String_clean(rLStr)

One-line Summary: fix TargetAV permute in rearrange

Purpose of changes: fix problem when targetAV enters
  the rearrange with valid values then gets unpermuted.
  Normally this won't be an issue because the targetAV
  enters with zero values, doesn't need to be unpermuted
  or is filled completely when rearranged.
