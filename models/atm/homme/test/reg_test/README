We need to create a set of "official" regression tests.
Here we are documenting the test cases in use at Sandia 
as unofficial regression tests.

These tests should be run in both the trunk and your branch
to ensure changes you have made have not broken existing code.
To check for bit-for-bit (BFB), output should be identical. To
check for rounding-error level changes, several statistics are
highlighted.

There are a couple of short BFB tests and an exact restart test
that should be sufficient for changes to the 3D code that are
BFB.  Non-BFB changes require verifing minimal changes in l2
solution errors,conservation errors, energy budget errors, and
checking plots of the vorticity field and and tracers.

Each script uses the build system in build/ to compile and runs
with an appropriate namelist, but none are queue-ready on any
machine at this time. They can be launched individually through
the individual_tests/ directory, or you can run all of them
(except baro-dg, because it takes significantly longer to run)
with the alltests.sh script. Again, these can only be run
interactively at the moment.

shallow water equations:
   explicit leapfrog    
   explicit Runge-Kutta 
   sign-preserving limiter

3D PRIMITIVIE EQUATION TESTS -- DETAILS


When rebaselining, in addition to extra details specified below for
individual tests (i.e. exact restart, conservation), one should also:

   (1) look at stdout/log file and verify:
        tracer/tracer mass consistency:  tracer number 4 min/max 1.0 to 12 digits:
           qv=   0.999999999999636E+00  0.100000000000039E+01  0.561600000000003E+06
        check tracer mass conservation:  "Q diss" is near zero:
               (Q-Q0)/Q0   0.740187328509209E-14   Q1
               (Q-Q0)/Q0   0.146454099118228E-13   Q2
               (Q-Q0)/Q0   0.470825202983687E-14   Q3
               (Q-Q0)/Q0   0.625678319683976E-14   Q4
   (2) Run NCL script and verify that the l2 PS error has not changed:
             baro2b.sh:  l2 PS error at day 9:  1.13mb
             baro2d.sh:  l2 PS error at day 9:  1.25mb 
   (3) Example plots of PS, zeta and tracers produced by NCL script and
       compare with reference plots on github.    

   stdout will be stored:
     test output:     [cmake build directory]/tests/baro2d/movies
     baseline output: [cmake build directory]/tests/baseline/baro2d/movies
   NCL script to make plots and compute l2 error:
     ACME/models/atm/homme/test/reg_test/ncl/baro2.ncl 
   Reference solution plots and 'T340ref.nc' available from homme-archive repo:  
     https://github.com/ACME-Climate/homme-archive/tree/master/test/reg_test/ref_sol




baro2b.sh   Test case from Jablonowski and Williamson 2006
            Spectral Element core
            (with 4 tracers, per ASP)
            Runge-Kutta timestepping with subcycling + hyper-viscosity 
            sign preserving limiter 
            nu_p=nu
            Output using PIO_INTERP
            NE=15, NP=4, PLEV=26, dt=180
            Run the configuration in this script, visually
            compare plots produced in q.pdf (either run
            in branch AND trunk or compare to plots in
            baro2b-ref.pdf in ref_sol/)

baro2c.sh   first runs 9 days of the JW baroclinic test case (to get to an
            interesting flow field).  Then do a short restart run
            with a very small timestep to measure mass and energy
            conservation.  IE dissipation should be very small.
            KE dissipation should be matched by heating term, resulting
            in very small total energy dissipation.

            Verification:  mass and tracer mass conservation to machine precision.
            verify IE,KE balance to machine precision
            verify tracer variance dissipation has not changed significantly  
            This script will make two runs: run1: 9 days and writes a restart file
            run2: restarts from this file and runs 3 timesteps.       
            Example output from last timstep of run2:  
             
KE,d/dt,diss:  0.16556417255055E+07  0.38649033390296E-01 -0.25801357782547E-01

PE,d/dt,diss:  0.63765066746567E+03  0.12525807506476E-01  0.98007470195061E-11
 E,dE/dt       0.26233326563496E+10  0.63578287760417E-07
Q1,Q diss, dQ^2/dt:  0.65215821593973E+04 kg/m^2  0.0000000E+00 -0.4239988E-03
        
Verify that:
  KE diss = -.25e-1
  IE diss = +.25e-1
  PE diss = O(e-11)
  Q diss  = O(e-14)
  dE/dt   = .8e-8   
  dQ^2/dt = -.42e-3



baro2d.sh   Test case from Jablonowski and Williamson 2006
            Same as baro2b.sh, but configred to match CAM-SE (Eulerian)
            subcycled tracers and hyperviscosity, nu_p=nu, nu_div=3*nu
            monotone limiter            
            Output using PIO_INTERP
            NE=15, NP=4, PLEV=26, dt=180
            Regression test runs for 9 day.  



baroCamMoist.cmake
