5/1/2013 updated by Aaron Lott, Andy Salinger, and Kate Evans for a more modern interface
adding a block preconditioner, using piro, and allowing a 3D and 2D solve using the same 
xstate passed through.
__________________

To use the implicit solver for the 2D or 3D version of HOMME, copy over the 
trilinosOptions.xml into the run directory you will use. 

To build and run the fully implicit solver option, first build the code with
the SWIM and PRIM options enabled. A working build of trilinos with the packages 
required by the LOCA/NOX solver is needed. This version of the code is kept 
current with the default build of Trilinos on ORNL's Titan system.

Then select the integration='full_imp' option in the namelist, and copy over the
.xml files, as instructed above, to the run directory and run the code as desired.
  
-------------------

7/31/2009 directory added to the repository for eventual link to the implicit
solver option in /src/implicit_mod.F90, which has routines that call the
subroutines in this directory: noxinit, noxsolve, and noxfinalize
(not including the preconditioner)

This directory contains the routines to call the trilinos solver packages. 
The trilinos library needs to be used for these routines to work.

To build Trilinos, the configure script in the file config_trilinos 
was used for the platform indicated. It will not stay in date as Trilinos
is updated, but provides a starting point for successfully building trilinos 
using the packages in HOMME For more info check out: http://trilinos.sandia.gov 

To use the implicit solver for the 2D shallow water version of HOMME, the 
input.xml.2d file and precon.xml files need to be copied into the local directory 
of the model run as input.xml and precon.xml so that the solver parameters can 
be assigned. These templates are provided as a starting point.
