general method that operates on the data.  this is generally
implemented in the data models but is set in the strdata method for
convenience.  valid options are dependent on the data model and will
be described elsewhere.  NULL is always a valid option and means no
data will be generated.  default='NULL'

datamode = "NULL"
  turns off the data model as a provider of data to the coupler.
  The atm_present flag will be set to false
  and the coupler will assume no exchange of data to or from the data model. 
datamode = "COPYALL"
  The default science mode of the data model is the COPYALL mode.
  COPYALL mode will examine the fields found in all input data streams,
  if any input field names match the field names used internally, they
  are copied into the export array and passed directly to the coupler
  without any special user code.  Any required fields not found on an
  input stream will be set to zero except for aerosol deposition fields
  which will be set to a special value.  There are several other
  scientific modes supported by the model, they are listed below.  The
  mode is selected by a character string set in the strdata namelist
  variable dataMode.

  The same as COPYALL mode.

  In conjunction with with CORE Version 2 atmospheric forcing data,
  provides the atmosphere forcing favored by the Ocean Model Working
  Group when coupling an active ocean model with observed atmospheric
  forcing.  This mode and associated data sets implement the CORE-IAF
  Version 2 forcing data, as developed by Large and Yeager (2008) at
  NCAR.  See the documentation for CORE version 2 datasets at
  http://data1.gfdl.noaa.gov/nomads/forms/mom4/COREv2.html Also see

  interannually varying air-sea flux data set.  
  Clm Dyn doi 10.1007/s00382-008-0441-3.
datamode = "CLMNCEP"
  In conjunction with NCEP climatological atmosphere data, provides the
  atmosphere forcing favored by the Land Model Working Group when
  coupling an active land model with observed atmospheric forcing.  This
  mode replicates code previously found in CLM (circa 2005), before the
  LMWG started using the CCSM flux coupler and data models to do
  active-land-only simulations.

time should be exactly one day throughout the dataset and the computed
maximum divided by minimum delta time should always be 1.0.  for
monthly data, the delta time should be between 28 and 31 days and the
maximum ratio should be about 1.1.  the running value of the delta
time is computed as data is read and any wraparound or cycling is also
