models/lnd/clm/tools/clm4_5/interpinic/README				Jun/04/2013

Tool to interpolate initial datasets to a different resolution or
mask.

=====================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTE!!!:: BE SURE TO USE NetCDF4.3 WHEN BUILDING!
   If your template file was written using pnetcdf -- interpinic will corrupt
   the resulting file and make it unusable!

   On yellowstone with csh this means doing the following...

          > module load netcdf/4.3.0-rc4

          > setenv INC_NETCDF $NETCDF/include
          > setenv LIB_NETCDF $NETCDF/lib

   This is also true of the script "addmetadata" which needs to use a version of
   NetCDF Operators (NCO) built with NetCDF4.3. On yellowstone currently that is
   /glade/apps/contrib/nco-4.2.3-temp.

=====================================================================================

Running gnumake in this directory will create an executable named

   "interpinic"  

Its function is to map an input clm initial file to an output clm initial file,
where the output clm initial file is overwritten with the interpolated values.

USAGE:

interpinic [-a] -i <input initial data file>  -o <output initial data file>

OPTIONS:

-a                            To abort if find missing types that aren't matched
                              from the input file. By default will overwrite missing
                              types with the nearest bare soil.
-i <input initial data file>  File to interpolate from.
-o <output initial data file> Input/Output file to interpolate to.

Options to gmake:

gmake OPT=FALSE    # will compile with debug compiler options on
gmake SMP=TRUE     # will compile with Open-MP parallelism on

If SMP is TRUE, then should invoke interpic as follows:

env OMP_NUM_THREADS <numthreads> interpinic -i <input initial data file>  -o <output initial data file>

See Also: See the models/lnd/clm/tools/README file for more notes about setting
          the path for NetCDF and running with shared-memory parallelism.
