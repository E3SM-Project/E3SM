!
! Sample input file of global datasets to extract a region from. Only works
! on standard 2D CLM files such as: fatmlndfrc, fsurdat, flanduse_timeseries, 
! stream_fldfilename_ndep, stream_fldfilename_lightng, and/or 
! stream_fldfilename_popdens.
!
! format: list of filenames similar to namelist format with a single line
!         per file with the format of:
!
! variable = "filepath"
!
! Lines (such as these) with "!" are ignored.
! 
  
! fatmlndfrc is REQUIRED! MUST BE ON THE SAME GRID AS ALL OF THE DATAFILES BELOW!!!!

 fatmlndfrc = '/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/inputdata/share/domains/domain.lnd.fv1.9x2.5_gx1v6.090206.nc'
!
! The following files are interpolated by default so technically do NOT need
! to be extracted, but it will help performance.
!
 stream_fldfilename_ndep = '/glade/p/cesmdata/cseg/inputdata/lnd/clm2/ndepdata/fndep_clm_hist_simyr1849-2006_1.9x2.5_c100428.nc'
