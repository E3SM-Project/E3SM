The land model is unique because it supports land data and now snow
data (lnd and sno) almost as if they were two separate components, but
they are in fact running in one component model through one interface.
The land data is associated with the main land model.  The snow data
is associated with snow accumulation code (for glacial formation)
inside the land model and is normally on a different grid than the
land data.  Each of these models, land, runoff, and snow need to have
their own shr_strdata_nml input because they are distinct sets of
fields on distinct grids with their own modes.  In the data model, the
land and snow modes are treated completely independently as
if there were two models.
datamode = "NULL"
  NULL is always a valid option and means no data will be generated.  
  Turns off the data model as a provider of data to the coupler.  The
  ice_present flag will be set to false and the coupler will assume no
  exchange of data to or from the data model.
dataMode = "COPYALL"
  Copies all fields directly from the input data streams Any required
  fields not found on an input stream will be set to zero.
datamode = "CPLHIST"
  Reads in data from coupler history files generated by a previous run 

Set by the following xml variables in env_run.xml
DLND_MODE

category="streams"
group="shr_strdata_nml" >
array (up to 30 elements) of delta time ratio limits placed on the
time interpolation associated with the array of streams.  this real
value causes the model to stop if the ratio of the running maximum
delta time divided by the minimum delta time is greater than the
dtlimit for that stream.  for instance, with daily data, the delta
time should be exactly one day throughout the dataset and the computed
maximum divided by minimum delta time should always be 1.0.  for
monthly data, the delta time should be between 28 and 31 days and the
maximum ratio should be about 1.1.  the running value of the delta
time is computed as data is read and any wraparound or cycling is also
included.  this input helps trap missing data or errors in cycling.
to turn off trapping, set the value to 1.0e30 or something similar.

stream_input_filename is a stream text input file and the format and
options are described elsewhere.  year_align, year_first, and
year_last provide information about the time axis of the file and how
to relate the input time axis to the model time axis.
