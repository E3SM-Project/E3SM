M       shr/shr_scam_mod.F90
        - Add "force_prognostic_true" to the docn namelist. This is not
          actually used, but it is an error to omit it, if the namelist in
          docn_in contains a value for this variable.

One-line summary: Add shr_assert macros, minor updates, and pFUnit tests.

A       shr/shr_assert.h

        - New preprocessor macro interface for shr_assert, as well as the
          new shr_assert_all and shr_assert_any subroutines. The macros
          here are turned off if NDEBUG is defined, which gets rid of any
          costs associated with the expressions fed in as arguments.

M       shr/shr_assert_mod.F90
M       shr/shr_assert_mod.F90.in

        - shr_assert now only accepts scalars. This is NOT backwards
          compatible.

        - New shr_assert_all and shr_assert_any functions introduced.
          shr_assert_all is equivalent to the old shr_assert. Currently,
          these are trivial one-liners, but they are intended to make it
          easier to modify the error reporting for array inputs at some
          point in the future.

        - shr_assert_in_domain can now accept an absolute (but not
          relative) error tolerance. This is primarily intended to make
          the eq/ne tests more useful for floating point inputs. However,
          they still work for integers as well.

        - Attempt to simplify a little bit of the cpp/genf90/conditional
          messiness.

M       shr/shr_infnan_mod.F90
M       shr/shr_infnan_mod.F90.in

        - Change the way a negative infinity bit pattern is produced, to
          prevent a (more or less spurious) compilation error with
          gfortran. We may be able to remove the -frange-check option from
          compilation flags after this.

M       shr/shr_spfn_mod.F90

        - Use reals of an explicit kind to set parameters. This really does
          nothing for this particular case, except that it will prevent
          precision issues in the unlikely event that some of these
          parameters are copied in the future.

A       unit_testers/new_framework/shr_spfn_test/test_igamma.pf

        - Replace unit tests for shr_assert_mod, shr_infnan_mod, and
          shr_spfn_mod with tests based on the new CMake+pFUnit framework.

        - The parameterized tests use the pFUnit 2.1 interface; they should
          be transitioned to the pFUnit 3.0 interface, which is simpler.

        - Note that the test coverage for shr_assert_mod has dropped
          dramatically. This is largely because the tests in the old system
          were extremely long, arbitrary, and repetitive, so many have just
          been dropped completely. They may be rewritten in a saner way
          during future refactorings.

        - Note also that test_infnan.F90 does not work with floating point
          trapping enabled. The test is effectively skipped when compiling
          with floating-point trapping on (including with CESM_DEBUG build
          flags).

M       shr/shr_infnan_mod.F90.in
M       shr/shr_infnan_mod.F90
         - Remove shr_test_infnan_mod.F90, as it was only needed by Lahey,
           GNU, and some versions of Cray, and was excessively complex.
         - Modify shr_infnan_mod.F90 to work for GNU. Any other compiler
           without the IEEE_ARITHMETIC intrinsic module will need to add an
           "isnan" function here, but the GNU workaround should provide all
           the other functionality for this module.
         - Created shr_infnan_to_r4 and shr_infnan_to_r8 as convenience
           functions (making it unnecessary to create temporary reals in
           some cases).

M       shr/shr_spfn_mod.F90
         - Remove references to Lahey and a workaround for older IBM
           compilers.
         - Remove "nonintrinsic" interfaces; cam5_3_04 and later do not use
           them. Remove internal error function interfaces that are also no
           longer needed.
         - Minor simplification using the F2003 "import" statement.

M       unit_testers/Makefile
         - Remove references to deleted source files.
         - Remove an empty file called "F" that is mysteriously generated
           on Mira, apparently by xlf2003_r.

M       unit_testers/make.Macros
         - Change pgf90 to the more generic "pgfortran".
         - Remove Lahey build information.
         - Define "CPRGNU" for gfortran.
         - If OS is Linux and compiler is xlf2003_r, use the correct
           compiler options for Mira.

M       unit_testers/test_shr_infnan.F90
         - Set bit patterns in a standard-conforming way (F2003).
         - Test new shr_infnan_mod functions.

A       shr/shr_infnan_mod.F90.in
M       shr/shr_infnan_mod.F90
        - Previously, assigning an array to Inf/NaN was a slow operation.
          Changing to genf90.pl, assigning Inf/NaN to a scalar, and using
          the scalar to set the output array, we get much better
          performance on Intel (e.g. ~20x speed up when initializing CAM's
          physics_state).

One-line summary: Fix bug with Intel compiler and shr_spfn_mod.

M     shr/shr_spfn_mod.F90
       - ifort experiences an internal error if you use an intrinsic (e.g.
         "gamma") in a function, and then rename that function to "gamma".
         However, this can be circumvented by adding one extra layer of
         indirection, e.g. by renaming a function by putting it in a
         generic interface block. I have done this, so it will be possible
         for modules to use this statement:

         use shr_spfn_mod, only: gamma => shr_spfn_gamma

One-line summary: Fix bug with optional argument to shr_sys_abort

M     shr/shr_sys_mod.F90
       - shr_sys_abort passed an optional error string to len_trim without
         checking if it is present. On many (most) compilers this is harmless,
         but can cause a run-time error that prevents the error message from
         being printed properly.

One-line summary: Add shr_assert_mod

A       shr/dtypes.h
         - Defines CPP macros for genf90.pl code.

A       shr/shr_assert_mod.F90.in
A       shr/shr_assert_mod.F90
         - Define two new "assert" subroutines.
            - shr_assert takes a logical and optional error strings,
              and aborts if that logical is .false.
            - shr_assert_in_domain takes a number, optional error
              strings, and arguments specifying a range of valid
              values. If the numerical value does not lie in the
              specified range, it aborts.
         - There is a ".in" file that generates the other file as
           genf90.pl code.
         - The assert routines can operate on arrays.

M       models/csm_share/shr/shr_infnan_mod.F90
         - Add ability to generate quiet (non-signaling) NaN.

M       models/csm_share/shr/shr_sys_mod.F90
         - If shr_log_Unit is not 6, mirror abort messages to 6 so
           that the reason for an abort can always be found in stdout
           (this is also the CESM log).

         - Unit test for shr_assert_mod.
         - This has a separate Makefile because it was difficult to
           integrate with the existing unit test builds.
         - The test can be run by defining the COMPILER environment
           variable (valid options are the same as for Machines,
           uppercase) and running "make test".
         - The test produces a file called test.log with the results.

One-line summary: Add shr_spfn_mod, cleanup shr_infnan_mod.

A       shr/shr_spfn_mod.F90
        - New module that provides an interface for these
          functions, whether or not the F2008 intrinsic
          is available:
          - erf
          - erfc
          - erfc_scaled
          - gamma
        - Provide upper incomplete gamma function (igamma),
          which is not intrinsic.
        - This is meant to provide a common interface for
          CAM and CLM code which had previously either
          assumed intrinsics were available, or else had
          never used intrinsics whether or not they were
          available.

M       shr/shr_infnan_mod.F90
        - Add comments explaining use.
        - Cleanup a few things:
          - Get rid of unnecessary capitals.
          - Narrow effects of Lahey workarounds so that
            "private" and "save" are specified.
        - Accommodate shr_test_infnan_mod changes.

          nagfor again, and *mostly* works on Lahey. (Lahey
          doesn't completely allow non-stop arithmetic, at
          least with these options. Possibly this aspect of
          IEEE arithmetic is only required in Fortran 2003?)

that effectively splits up shr_dmodel_translateAV into an initialization routine
(shr_dmodel_translat_list) that is only called once to determine the translation
list and shr_dmodel_translateAV_list (where the translation list is passed in)
to significantly speed up applications where shr_dmodel_translatAV is called
at very high frequency (such as tower site calculations). DATM has been modified 
to use these two new routines.	
These changes are completely backward compatible) - and tests show bfb results 
with all data model compsets.

One-line summary: Add ability to do cosine of solar zenith angle scaling to time-interpolation

Move vers10_share3_080925 to the trunk

Add ability to do cosine of solar zenith angle scaling to the time-interpolation module.
This also means adding data and methods in shr_stream module to optionally track the
time-interpolation method from the input streams. And it required adding additional
methods and options to shr_date module to get the previous time-step or day. As well
as a method to broadcast character string arrays.

Also bug 786 was fixed for dshr_map so that it works when the field list are different.

G95 capability was added. And return codes were followed more carefully so that the
unit tests function correctly for failed tests. And a read-only option was added to
the open method in dshr_iocdf module.


M      dshr/dshr_iocdf.F90 ---------------- Add readonly option to open method.
M      dshr/dshr_tInterp.F90 -------------- Add dshr_tInterp_calcCosZenNorm method and

One-line summary: update shr logging status
- fix bug in mct_myindex when lsize is zero.  only detected for
  certain resolutions at high pes counts.  does not impact answers.
- change unit 6 to "logunit" in all write calls in shr, dshr, eshr
- add loglevel logic to control writing in most write statements
- add shr_const_logLevel, shr_const_logUnit to store new variables.
  note these are not parameters and are in shr_const as it's the
  lowest level module in share code.  that way, all modules in 
  shr, dshr, and eshr can reference these variables directly
  without having to execute a get (which would be painful to implement)
- add new interfaces for use with new logging capabilities.

One-line summary: local copy of dx7 input data is no longer required (bugz #72)

In general, address bugz #72: allow dx7 models to read input data files 
in any NFS mounted dir without making a local copy of the file.
If a file path/name starts with "cp:" (or "mss:"), then call shr_file_get to 
make a local copy, else read the file without making a local copy.

- dshr_domain_mod, dshr_dataIn_mod, shr_stream_mod: 
  if a data file is a normal unix file-path/name (eg. "/fis/inputdata/foo.nc")
  then DON'T call shr_file_get() to acquire a local copy of it
  if "cp:" is prepended to a file's path/name (eg. "cp:/fis/inputdata/foo.nc")
  then DO call shr_file_get() to make a local copy of it ("./foo.nc")
- shr_ncio_read() no longer calls shr_file_get, calling routine must do it,
  if necessary

One-line summary: Add asynchronous messaging option, make 
   modules public/private, add unit tests, add more platforms
Changes made:

shr_msg_mod has an asynchronous messaging option. 

Make all modules more careful about declaring data and methods 
public or private. In general try to make all modules private 
with explicit declarations on public data and methods. shr_msg_mod 
is still public as it includes "mpif.h" which is assumed to be 
included by most other models.

Add "unit_testers" directory with a few useful unit tests.

Allow shr_sys_mod to work on more platforms: SunOS, and Linux.

One-line summary: Change case of kind parameters, add OSF capability.
Changes made:

 Tony upgraded the share library for the Compaq. 

 "convert isend to send in shr_msg_mod.F90
 add OSF (compaq) system calls to shr_sys_mod.F90 and shr_timer_mod.F90"

 Change case of kind parameters to upper-case. This seemed to be an 
 issue on the SGI. I don't think case-sensitivity is in the FORTRAN standard, 
 but the parameters are addressed as upper-case, and it certainly shouldn't 
 hurt anything.

Changes made:

	Added a argument to orb_params to determine if you want
to print messages out or not.  Normally this should be set to
true, but if you are running a program under SPMD you will want
the master to set it to true and the slaves set it to false.
Otherwise, all the processesors print out the same messages.

	Added a list of coupler compatibility message numbers.
that are set and can be used as the coupler changes.  These 
values can not be changed at this point!

Changes made:

	Change orbit so that either IYEAR_AD or (ECCEN,OBLIQ,MVELP) has
to be set rather than specifying defaults. This makes it much more clear
what the orbital parameters are set to, since the user HAS to enter it
as a required namelist item.  If the parameters aren't set, a long message
comes up that displays what possible values might be.

Other files were moved from "orbit" into the main directory.  So
now there are only two directories -- the main "csm_share" directory
and the one sub-directory "msg" for the files dealing with the 
message passing interface.

Version: SHARE1.0.2
One-line summary: Moved files to subdirectories, added msgid for cpl, 
		added receive for char.
Changes made:

o Moved files to subdirectories.  

	By doing this we can easily pick which set
of functions each model needs to share, and we can swap out different packages.
For example, we can easily pick a different message passing library by 
compiling the interface routine in the PVM sub-directory for example.  Also
we can place functions dealing with non-NCAR machines here and only add them
in the list to compile if we are at a non-NCAR site.

Subdirectories:
	msg ----- generic message passing files (non-library dependent)
	orbit --- subroutines dealing with the earths orbit. Solar declination,
			Solar zenith angle, and eath-sun distance factor.
	MPI ----- subroutines interfacing to the MPI message passing library.

Updated the README file to document the above changes.  Also suggest names
for other sub-directories to add later (constants, MSS etc.).

o Added a task identifier for the coupler in msgid.h: MSGID_TID_CPL

o Added the character receive function to the MPI msg_wrapper.F (msg_recv_c).

Version: SHARE1.0
One-line summary: Initial version, orbit and message compatability.
Changes made:

Initial version of the shared CSM library.

The purpose of this library is to archive all the code used by CSM models
THAT HAS TO BE THE SAME!  This way we have one location to look for code
that is shared.  So the earth's orbital parameters, and message passing
type codes are archived here.  Other codes regarding the calender and
physical constants could also be put here as well.  This helps to ensure
that models have the same expressions for functions shared across the board.
It is also a more efficient programming paradigm.  And finally it makes it
easier for other models to link into CSM, since all of the interface
requirements are packaged up into one location.

Currently the codes that are here are in three classes...

Orbit:

	Orbital codes to calculate earths' orbital parameters and get solar
	declination angle, earth-sun distance factor, and cosine of the solar 
	zenith angle.

Message Compatability:

	These codes check the messages from the coupler and ensure that the
	version of the coupler messages is compatable with the version
	that is expected.

README/ChangeLog/ChangeSum:

	The README file gives some background on why we created this module
	and how we want/need to manage it.

	ChangeLog gives a long description of changes made.

	ChangeSum is a one-line description of changes made.

At this point only the atmosphere and land components are accessing these
codes, but later all models will use all or part of the codes shared here.
