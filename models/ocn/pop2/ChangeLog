Tag Summary: The best description is probably just to say this is version 2.0
             of ecosys_mod. There is no backwards compatibility, for ecosys
             version 1.0, use CESM 1.1.1 or CESM 1.0.5.

Tests:       Ran CECO compsets with T62_g16, f09_g16_rx1, and T31_g37_rx1
             resolutions. Also ran C compsets on T62_g16 and T31_g37_rx1 to
             check that non-ecosys modes were still bit-for-bit with the trunk
             (cesm1_2_alpha07b).Built and ran using pgi compiler to check
             multiple compilers.

Tag Summary: Three separate bug fixes
             1) io_netcdf.F90 fixes issue with CECO + pnetcdf
             2) pop2.buildnml.csh cleans up remnants of a change made
                in 20120919 tag but removed in 20120927 tag (left one
                block of code in by mistake)
             3) rest of files are a fix that checks to see if any tavg
                stream files are still open at the end of the run and,
                if so, closes them.

Tag Summary: Keith Lindsay found a bug in the cfc namelist script dating back
             to at least CCSM 4.0. Basically, cfcs were being set to zero for
             hybrid and branch runs in transient cases for all start dates,
             while they should have non-zero values after 1930.

Testing:     Keith provided me with a working version of ocn.cfc.setup.csh for
             1.0.5, I ported the changes to build-namelist and ensured the
             namelists I generated in 1.1.1 matched his 1.0.5 namelists.

Tag Summary: The blockone decomposition Tony introduced was causing issues
             with 30 ocean tasks and the gx3v7 resolution. As a workaround
             I hard-coded decompositions for 30 procs in pop_decomp.xml

Notes:       The blockone code can handle 15 ocean tasks, but I found that
             adding a decomposition to pop_decomp.xml (blocks of 20x39 cells
             with 5x3 layout of blocks over the tasks) was faster. In the
             interest of not changing too much, I did not add this "better"
             decomposition... but it should be the starting point of a
             discussion. Similarly, a hard-coded 45 task decomposition
             (blocks of 20x13 with 5x13 layout of blocks over the tasks) ran
             roughly the same speed as a blockone 45 task decomposition but
             since blockone could handle 45 tasks i did not include my
             decomposition in pop_decomp.xml.

Tag Summary: Brought in Tony's blockone decomposition. If you do not use a
             decomposition supported in bld/pop_decomp.xml, build-namelist
             will compute a decomposition rather than erroring out.

Testing:     Showed that this is bit-for-bit out-of-the-box with a C compset
             and both the ne30_g16 and ne120_t12 resolutions (using NTASKS_OCN
             set by create_newcase). Also showed that non-default task counts
             that were previously unsupported do not change the answer more
             than other supported decompositions. For ne120_t12, that involved
             running with NTASK_OCN = 1024 (default), 960 (supported in
             pop_decomp.xml), as well as both 1025 and 1230 (both required
             intervention by blockone).

Tag Summary: Coupling every 30 minutes caused problems in how build-namelist set
             up time_manager_nml (ihour0 = 0.5 is bad when ihour is an integer).
             This update moves the logic for computing coupled_freq up to when
             we read in XML variables and then computes iyear0, imonth0, iday0,
             ihour0, iminute0, and isecond0 properly.

Tag Summary: build-namelist didn't know how to handle coupling every 30 minutes
             (by default, couple_freq_opt was always 'nhour' and couple_freq was
             1,2,3,4,6,8,12, or 24... setting OCN_NCPL=48 in env_run was not
             supported). Now build-namelist behaves similarly to the driver
             build-namelist in order to determine how frequently pop will need
             to communicate with the coupler.

Tag Summary: Tag from Sept 19 caused problems with ER* tests. It's complicated,
             but the first problem was copying rpointer.ocn.init with the rest
             of the rpointer files when cloning a case. Then it turned out that
             the lack of an rpointer.ocn.init file should lead to reading the
             init_ts_file_fmt from rpointer.ocn.restart rather than defaulting
             to bin... and around this time Tony Craig pointed out that right
             now users are told that they need ALL rpointer files from a ref
             run, so it's confusing to say "except rpointer.ocn.init". Long
             story short, we decided that the best solution was to remove
             rpointer.ocn.init and just get init_ts_file_fmt from wherever
             the reference data is. Eventually we will prestage before running
             pop2.buildnml.csh and none of this will matter because we will
             have the correct rpointer.ocn.restart file in $RUNDIR. Until then,
             this seems like a better solution than the one implemented on the
             19th.

Testing:     Ran ERI_PT.B1850CN test that had been falling with the Sep 19 tag,
             it now passes. Also repeated the test from the 19th to ensure the
             bug fixed then did not creep back in.

Tag Summary: Main task - updating diags_on_lat_aux_grid to handle outputting
             tavg streams when OCN_PIO_ROOT is not master_task. Additionally,
             added a handful of POP_IOUnitsFlush calls to aid in debugging.

Testing:     Keith Lindsay pointed out that running a G1850ECO compset on
             bluefire with OCN_PIO_ROOT = -99 failed. So I ran the same compset
             with OCN_PIO_ROOT = 0, saved the history files, and then ensured
             that using OCN_PIO_ROOT = -99 returns bit-for-bit results.

Tag Summary: Bugfix - re-running a hybrid or branch run (not continuing the
             run, but starting over) used to have a problem determining the
             file format for the initial conditions, this tag fixes that.

Testing:     Ran a hybrid run for 5 days, re-ran it (used to error out but now
             works), set CONTINUE_RUN to TRUE, ran for 5 days, and then set
             CONTINUE_RUN back to FALSE and re-ran it one more time. Also built
             a regular C case (startup, not hybrid).

                 tracer_init_ext (iage_nml, cfc_nml, ecosys_nml)
                 gas_flux_fice (cfc_nml, ecosys_nml)
                 gas_flux_ws (cfc_nml, ecosys_nml)
                 gas_flux_ap (cfc_nml, ecosys_nml)

             This also lead to changes in how build-namelist handles variables
             in the "derived" group. Most changes were of the behind-the-scenes
             variety, but one big difference is that the add_default() routine
             can handle derived types on its own. Specifically,

                 add_default($nl, 'rich_mix&vmix_rich_nml');
                 $derived = $nl->get_value('rich_mix&vmix_rich_nml');
                 $nl->set_value('vmix_rich_nml', 'rich_mix', "$derived");

             has been replaced with the much simpler

                 add_default($nl, 'rich_mix&vmix_rich_nml');

             Additionally, I noticed a typo in the comments of user_nl_pop2.

Testing:     Built C, CECO, and B20TRBDRD testcases with new build-namelist,
             compared pop2_in to old version. Also used user_nl_pop2 to add
             changed variables (see above)

Tag Summary: Updated how build-namelist reads user_nl_pop2. You can now
             specify a namelist with entries like

                 var_name&namelist_name_nml = value

             whether var_name appears in multiple namelists or not. I also
             updated the namelist definition file to remove definitions for
             variables that appear in multiple namelists -- the derived types
             should be the only entries. I still need to update the definitions
             for tracer module variables appearing in multiple namelists and
             edit scripts/doc/nldef2html_pop2 to produce correct documentation

Testing:     Built C testcase with new build-namelist, compared pop2_in to
             old version

Tag Summary: 1) the scripts/ directory has changed; the biggest effect to POP
                is moving some set up from Buildconf/configure to the
                pop2.buildnml.csh script. Also changes $OBJROOT to $EXEROOT in
                a few places. Note: to set up a new case, run "./setup" from
                $CASEROOT rather than "./configure -case"
             2) Nancy and Gokhan asked me to update error message associated
                with using linertial = .true.
Testing:     Built C compset using new scripts.

Tag Summary: Updated build-namelist to suppress "file status unknown" warnings
             in prestage when variables named *_file have non-file values. The
             change effects how the following four namelist values are treated:
               * init_iage_file = 'same_as_TS'
               * bottom_cell_file = 'unknown_bottom_cell'
               * tidal_energy_file = 'unknown_tidal_mixing'
               * niw_energy_file = 'unknown_niw_energy'
             I think those are the only four that could cause this kind of error
             but if more crop up it's a simple update to fix.
Testing:     Still successfully built, errors in prestage are gone.

Tag Summary: * Primary purpose: more updates to new build system (mostly adding
               documentation to namelist_definitions_pop2.xml, but also moving
               some values calculated directly in build-namelist to the defaults
               file).
             * Additional development: Increased max_avail_tavg_fields to 2000
               in tavg.F90 to remove -DCESMMOBY from build system; fixed a typo
               in a comment in passive_tracers.F90

Tag Summary: Big change -- namelist variables that appear in multiple namelists
             are now set use var_name&var_nml instead of var_name%var_nml in
             user_nl_pop. Also added a check to ensure that these variables are
             entered correctly in user_nl_pop (before var_name = val would not
             error out, but also won't change anything in pop2_in) and made the
             "-preview" flag in build-namelist functional -- it will print out
             "var_name = value in &var_nml" for every entry in user_nl_pop2.
             Lastly, updated the documentation in both README.build-namelist
             and the comments of user_nl_pop2, and started adding documentation
             to the namelist_definitions file (for Brian Eaton's XML -> HTML

Tag Summary: Lots of improvements to the build-namelist setup. Brian Eaton
             updated the perl libraries, so build-namelist has better support
             for arrays (including arrays of derived types) in the definitions
             file. I also made sure every variable in &ecosys_nml appears in
             the definitions file (including every component of any variables
             that are of derived type). Additionally, I cleaned up the way
             some variables in the cfc namelist are added (they now use the
             defaults file instead of having logic in build-namelist). Lastly,
             I added a hook to be able to pass build-namelist a "-preview" flag,
             which will soon enable users to see exactly how variables in
             user_nl_pop2 are being handled by the script when they run
             preview_namelists (without increasing output from $CASE.build).

Testing:     Compared namelists build for a variety of compsets that use pop2

Tag Summary: Merge bldnml branch onto trunk. This is the culmination of the

             Nancy helped ensure that the moby support she was adding to the
             trunk was not lost in this update.

Testing:     Documented in branch_tags/bldnml_tags/, but basically ensured that
             namelists generated with this system were identical to old ones and
             that output remained bit-for-bit.

Tag Summary: * correction to tavg.F90 (the cesm_pop_2_1_20120125 tavg bugfix
                    was overwritten in the cesm_pop_2_1_20120308 tag)
             * bring MOBY branch bld/*decomp* and drivers/cpl_mct/ocn_comp_mct.F90 files onto pop2 trunk

Testing:     * In a cesm1_1_beta09 base-model sandbox, created & ran C, T62_gx1v6 cases using
               cesm_pop_2_1_20120125 and this tag. Compiled and ran 6-day smoke tests and
               differenced the ocean restart and history files: b4b.
             * Ditto for CECO, except run for one month, then difference restart & history files: monthly
                  restart, base-model history, ecosys nday history files are all b4b.

Tag Summary: Add MOBY "hooks" to the pop2 base model
             This tag brings in modified pop2/source files that contain MOBY
             modifications, plus a "stub" version of moby_mod.F90. 

             This is the first of two steps towards bringing support for MOBY
             onto the pop2 trunk (without bringing the actual MOBY darwin code in).
             The second step will be to add a revised version of pop2.cpl7.template,
             moby.cpl7.template, and ocn.moby.setup.csh scripts that are compatible
             with the new namelist-build scripts, which will be done by Mariana
             Vertenstein.

Testing:     In a cesm1_1_beta09 sandbox, created & ran C, T62_gx1v6 case; compared
             with cesm1_1_beta09 oob.  New code compiles & runs; ocean restart
             files are b4b.

Tag Summary: Bugfix for N_HEAT, N_SALT tavg computation
             This is a bugfix for a minor error in the tavg.F90 module
             in the determination of the averaging method for N_HEAT and
             N_SALT.  In the out-of-the-box configuration, this bug was
             confirmed to have zero effect on the solutions. In modified
             configurations (eliminated some fields from tavg_contents),
             the bug caused the model to exit abnormally.

Testing:     With and without the bugfix, bluefire, cesm1_1_beta08. Diff'd
             N_HEAT, N_SALT daily averages (single precision) -- zero diffs.

Testing: 
Ran all bluefire and lynx prebeta tests and showed that the history files
were identical with and without the upcoming beta08 changes. The only exception
was debug tests on bluefire that were roundoff level different in pop. The same
debug tests when run without debugging were bfb the same.

Tag Summary: Replace dimensioned arrays with assumed-shape arrays in ecosys_mod.F90,
             in order to work around a subtle compiler issue (detected by an intel compiler)
             which occurs when the ecosys_mod and any other passive-tracer module with
             more than two (or three, in our default setup) tracers is compiled and

Tag Summary: 1) Change restart file fmt from 'bin' to 'nc' because list-directed
                  i/o is not b4b on some platforms
             2) Modify global sum routines so that automated 1x2 threading test is b4b, and
                instrument the POP_ReductionsMod module s.t. it responds to the "b4b"
                option in the same way as the global_sum routines in global_reductions.
                This second part allows for (non-automated) comparisons of certain
                threading vs non-threading test cases, such as 1x4, 4x1, 2x2; it is not
                totally general.
_________________________________________________________________________________________

From Keith Lindsay:
all mods are b4b if NTHRDS_OCN=1

global_reductions.F90:
    ensure (1 task, 2 threads) is b4b with (2 tasks, 1 thread),
    if both built with BUILD_THREADED=TRUE

POP_ReductionsMod.F90, initial.F90:
    ensure (m1 tasks, n1 threads) is b4b with (m2 tasks, n2 threads),
    if m1*n1 = m2*n2, i.e. same number of blocks, BUILD_THREADED=TRUE,
    and b4b_flag=.true. in context_nml
    This has an unquantified performance hit for large block counts.
_________________________________________________________________________________________
            
Testing: 1) Diane Feddema (2011-11-08): 
            when restart format is 'nc' tests on lynx are b4b; when it is 'bin', they are not.
         2) Keith Lindsay (2011-11-08):
bluefire, CECO, T62_gx3v7:

Tag Summary: Bugfix for CF-compliance
             There is no bug report, but email from Jim Edwards states:
             The attribute should be "Conventions"?  with both cap "C" at the beginning and "s" at the end. 

Testing:  njn01. T62_gx3v7, C with new io_netcdf.F90 on bluefire.
          3-day run, then 3-day restart with monthly history files, followed by 3-day restart with daily history files
          ncdump'd resulting pop*.nc files and confirmed "Conventions" replaces "conventions"

Tag Summary: Bugfix for Bug #1287 - missing metadata for meridional transport tavg variables
             Modify code so that the cell_methods attribute is added to MOC, N_HEAT,
             and N_SALT in the tavg history files.
Testing:  njn01. Set up three sets of side-by-side 1-month test runs  (T62_gx3v7, C)
          on bluefire. Tested the following settings:
             o OCN_TAVG_TRACER_BUDGET=FALSE, OCN_TAVG_HIFREQ=FALSE 
             o OCN_TAVG_TRACER_BUDGET=TRUE , OCN_TAVG_HIFREQ=TRUE 
             o OCN_TAVG_TRACER_BUDGET=FALSE, OCN_TAVG_HIFREQ=TRUE
          by differencing monthly and nday streams (ncl diff_files.ncl) and 
          by differencing these files' cdl files.

             * Comment out OMP directives in tavg.F90 (improper exit within
                a threaded region)  
             * Add high-resolution grid detection to pop2.cpl7.template script,
               to avoid relying on cesm1 script settings (which have been known
               to set HIRES incorrectly)
Testing: njn01:
           * T62_tx0.1v2, HIRES = false, with new pop2.cpl7.template: compiles with -D_HIRES; runs
           * T62_gx3v7, with new pop2.cpl7.template: compiles withOUT -D_HIRES; runs

Tag Summary: tavg module improvements 
             * Move all accumulation testing into subroutine accumulate_tavg_field
             * Create new subroutine, accumulate_tavg_now
             * Remove references to tavg_requested from all other modules;
               replace with accumulate_tavg_now in special instances where
               the test would potentially eliminate expensive computations
             * Make tavg_requested private, so that new developments cannot
               access it from outside modules

Tag Summary: Ecosystem-model changes by Keith Lindsay
             * Correct units metadata for IRON_FLUX tavg variable
             * Make pH solver more robust to large tracer changes in a single timestep, 
               by iteratively doubling the width of the pH search interval when necessary.
               The code will abort if 3 doublings is not sufficient.
=====
NOTE:        Solutions are bit-for-bit with the previous tag (except when the pH search
=====        interval is increased), but the carbonate *diagnostics* fields (CO3, HCO3, H2CO3)
             are slightly different because the phlo_3d_init value is different from the 
             previous tag)

  * same test cases, with newer pop2.cpl7.csh that corrects the 'unknown_region_mask'
    mismatch between code and scripts. Confirmed that the pop2.cpl7.csh now generates
    the proper string when region mask is not defined.

Tag Summary: bugfix: completely "streamify" tavg_method_qflux
             This bugfix allows any pop2 model variable, such as FvICE_DIC and
             FvICE_ALK, to use tavg_method_qflux in a
             stream different from the one containing QFLUX.
Tag Testing: * ccsm4_0_beta55+ = ccsm4_0_beta55 with ccsm_pop_2_1_20100521
     Compare files:
       * binary restart files at eod six   (b4b)
       * ncl diff script on
           o pop.h.ecosys.nday1.0001-01-02.nc files: only FvICE_ fields are different
       * ncl diff script on other pop.h.*.nc files:
           o pop.h.0001-01-05.nc are the same
           o pop.h.nday1.0001-01-02.nc are the same
     Compare FvICE_DIC and FvICE_ALK files (new vs old):
       * visual inspection: patterns are the same, magnitudes are different
     Compare ocn.log files:
       * global sums are identical (streams bug was fixed in previous
         version of tavg_global_sum_2D)

     Run one month, oob & test version. Create monthly mean (ncra) of daily
     FvICE_DIC fields and compare with oob case.  Visually inspect monthly
     FvICE_DIC fields and ncdiffs.  Same magnitude, max rel diff ~10% in
     regions of max FvICE_DIC magnitude.  Note setup error: "oob" case
     used modified tavg_nml settings and created stream #1 averages every
     four days, so the "oob monthly" field was actually an average of the
     four-day averages through the end of 0001-01-29.

             * Change clinic_distribution_type = balanced --> clinic_distribution_type = cartesian
               Recommended by Phil Jones to avoid the rake algorithm incompatability with "the
               Gokhan fix":
               " ...the rake has been effectively disabled.  Both
               John's added code in the DistributeCreate routine that
               sets all work/block to maxWork and Gokhan's added code in
               domain.F90 that does similar things with nocn (for coarse
               resolution), means that there are no land blocks and all
               blocks have the same amount of work.   So the rake algorithm
               is likely doing nothing, or worse (shifting blocks for no
               gain). You'd be better off sticking with Cartesian.

               If you'd like to remove both Gokhan's and John's kludges
               and make the rake work again, I'm happy to help.  But right
               now, the algorithm is doing nothing for you and may be
               doing you harm."

             * Correction: write out character-string data to tavg history file fields
                "moc_components", "transport_components", and "transport_regions". These
                character strings are blank in all pop.h* files created by tags ccsm4_0_beta35
                when pio was introduced in pop2, to ccsm4_0_beta46, the last tag before this
                correction will be made.
              * Incorporate new tx0.1v2 decompositions that are supported in the "hr" tag
              * Add a dummy line in input_templates/tx0.1v2_inputdata for the tx0.1v2
                 *.hdr file. With this dummy line in place, the input data checking tool
                 will detect if the *.hdr file is unavailable and will issue a fatal error.
                 This will protect users from trying to run a tx0.1v2 case without the *.hdr
                 file; without the *.hdr file, the model will note that the file is missing,
                 make (iincorrect) assumptions about the ordering of data on the restart file,
                 begin executing, and then die mysteriously.

Tag Summary:  1) Replace pure netCDF implementation in io_netcdf.F90 with pio version.
                 This implementation was developed by Mariana Vertenstein. The
                 code in this tag is based upon the piopop11_ccsm_pop_2_1_20091030/
                 pop2 branch code, but includes a correction to io_netcdf.F90 that
                 is not inthe piopop11 tag.
                 NOTE: the piopop11 tag does not contain the shared-constants version
                       of overflows.F90, so tests done with the piopop11 tag do not
                       directly compare with the code in this tag.
              2) bugfix pop2.cpl7.template wrt runtype and ecosystem interaction

   This tag contains major changes to the tavg.F90 and supporting modules. The
   new code allows for the creation of tavg timeseries files "on-the-fly",
   and by default, the code is set up to create timeseries files of the daily
   tavg history fields.

   Further testing of this tag may result in changes/corrections.

Summary of Changes:   
 
   *This is a significant revision to improve the support of multiple tavg output "streams".
    Extensive testing at the gx3v5 resolution was conducted (see test log) . This version 
    now contains support for writing time-invariant fields, such as background diffusivities,
    the the new frequency option, "once."

   * Correction of the (re-introduced) overflows.F90 threading bug
  
   * Addition of gx3v7 support

Summary of Changes:   This is a *preliminary* tag which contains a *MAJOR* 
                      revision to support multiple tavg output "streams".
                      Extensive testing and substantial modifications will
                      continue over the next several weeks; users should
                      consider this an "alpha" version of the tavg streams code.

Tag: pop2/trunk_tags/ccsm_pop_2_1_20090812
Summary of Changes:  
     * Major time-flag revision:
          Create the routine "access_time_flag" to allow
            other routines to access a time_flag defined in another module.
          Refactor routines to create smaller, single-purpose subroutines
            that can be combined in various ways to support robust time_flag
            creation and use.
          Allow only one module to initialize a time flag. 
          Add error checking to prevent using a noninitialized time_flag. 
     * add definition of undefined_nf_r8 to constants.F90
     * add optional output unit specifier to exit_POP
     * add support for overriding cpl_ts%old_value based upon restart information
     * remove code for overriding cpl_ts%old_value from read_restart 
         (now, override cpl_ts%old_value after it has been initialized)
     * change get_time_flag_id to access_time_flag in ice.F90, restart.F90,
     * remove shr_sys_flush references; use POP_IOUnitsFlush instead
     * replace missing_value with missing_value_d (double-precision value) in
         tavg attributes, for double-precision attributes.

Summary of Changes:  
     * Corrections:
         o update the tx1v1 chlorophyll dataset; the old one was mistakenly written 
            in little-endian format
         o add tripole-grid correction to DYU in grid.F90 (Gokhan/Keith)
         o interchange the order of allocate and INQUIRE statements in read_bottom_cell, 
             so that the record length for the partial bottom cell file is correctly determined
             (affected tx0.1v2 oob only)
         o modify pop2_in_build.csh to support restarts from netCDF restart files
     * Minor corrections (b4b solutions):
         o correct a minor bug in tavg.F90 module: write out ULON_DEG, TLON_DEG, ULAT_DEG,
            and TLAT_DEG in double precision
         o correct a minor bug in restart.F90 module: always set the variable "restart_type",
            every call, because tavg.F90 code depends on the value of restart_type.
     * Misc changes:
         o rename pop2/drivers/nocouple  pop2/drivers/cpl_none for improved name parallelism
            and modify build/* nocouple references to point to cpl_none
         o add "call POP_IOUnitsFlush(stdout) " to locations where POP_IOUnitsFlush(POP_stdout) 
            calls exist; this restores the flushes in ccsm coupled context during the
            transition from old to new pop2 infrastructure
         o eliminate some "call shr_sys_flush (stdout)" references and replace with
               call POP_IOUnitsFlush(POP_stdout) ; call POP_IOUnitsFlush(stdout)
            This touches a lot of files.

     * time-flag changes:
         o add support for an offset/reference date in time_to_do
         o reorganize/rename/restructure time-flag definitions, routines, and interfaces
         o add documentation
         o modify time-flag interfaces in modules using time flags (including stand-alone

         o add offset-date support to tavg_nml in pop2_in_build.csh
     * add new time_management.F90 unit tester
     * define record length in read_bottom_cell via an INQUIRE statement (bug #968)
     * remove ^M characters from serial/communicate.F90
     * restore printed completion messages to ocn.log.* output (use stdout, not POP_stdout)
        and print only from master-task (eliminates messages from each task in ccsm.log.*)
     * modify pop2.cpl7.template so that $INPUT is not resolved in the pop2.build* scripts 
        that the template script creates

Summary of Changes:  
     * Initialize arrays in cfc_mod.F90, which allows the ocean model compiled
       in DEBUG mode (NaN initialization and signal trapping) to properly execute.
      
Testing: preliminary testing: klindsay, mai Further testing: njn01
         All of the following tests pass.  In addition, the binary ocean restart files
         from ERT1850.f19_g16.B20TRTR1.bluefire and ERT1850.f19_g16.B20TRTR1.bluefire.with_cfc
         at the end of two months are identical

         DEBUG tests:
          * SMS_D.f19_g16.B20TRTR1.bluefire with Keith's cfc_mod.F90 in SourceMods/src.pop2
          * SMS_D.T62_g35.C.bluefire with Keith's cfc_mod.F90 *and* ltidal_mixing = .false.
            (so that the case will run)

         Exact-restart tests:
          * ERT1850.f19_g16.B20TRTR1.bluefire out-of-box (2-month exact restart test)
          * ERT1850.f19_g16.B20TRTR1.bluefire with Keith's cfc_mod.F90 in SourceMods/src.pop2

Summary of Changes:  
     * Add gx1v6 support
     * Add support for startup/spunup *.hdr file
     * Write tavg error message on all procs
     * Add extra info to io_netcdf.F90 error message
           ("string too short") to help eliminate confusion
     * Modify tx0.1v2_inputdata to reflect approved inputdata dataset names

Process:
    Get gx1v6 datasets from Steve Yeager. Modify pop2_in_build.csh
    to recognize gx1v6. Check gx1v6 datasets into inputdata and $SVN data
    repo.  Create gx1v6_input_data, pointing to new gx1v6 datasets.
    Modify pop_decomp.xml to recognize gx1v6. 

Testing (njn01):
     Modify ccsm4_0_beta09 (cice, clm, dice, dlnd, datm, scripts, pop2).
     Set up B compset. Compare $comp_in for comp = (drv,ice,lnd,atm,pop)
     with Steve Yeager's b40.008o case. Diff'd ocean and ice datasets
     with Steve Yeager's b40.008o case.
 
     Set up C compset. Will need new gx1v6 datasets before testing
     can be completed.  

     This tag will be updated, if necessary, after full gx1v6 test suite
     is completed.

Summary of Changes:  
   1) New overflows.F90 module and gx1v5b_overflow input file from
      Bruce B and Gokhan. The overflows.F90 module has been used
      extensively in recent runs; njn01 modified it to be consistent
      with the changes made in ccsm_pop_2_1_20090107a
   2) tx0.1v2_tavg_contents file from a38hr02_hrpop43 (JD mods)
   3) pop2_in_build.csh vmix_kpp_nml tx0.1v2 update
   4) Comment out call MPI_BARRIER in POP_CommMod.F90 (JD mod)
   5) Only check COMPUTE_TLT in hmix_gm.F90 if not _HIRES
   6) Add new tx0.1v2 blocks to pop_decomp.xml file (from a38hr02_hrpop43 tag)

Testing:  
   1) Bruce B confirmed on 9 Jan 2009 that the resulting overflows *.do* files are ok
   2) Compile and run a one-month gx1v5 C case.
   3) No testing of tx0.1v2 mods, beyond inspection

Summary of Changes:  
Add time-filtering of surface Chl to initialization so that it is
consistent with the time-filtering in the main time loop. Move set_chl
call in subroutine set_surface_forcing of forcing.F90 to eliminate
time-lag in prognostic Chl.

Testing:  
The mods ensure exact restart for compset CECO at resolutions T62_g35 &
T62_g15. They do not change results (bit-for-bit) for compset B at
resolution f19_g15 or for compset C at resolutions T62_g35 & T62_g15.
The bit-for-bit verification is for a 5 day startup run with
CONTINUE_RUN==FALSE as well as a 5 day continuation.

Summary of Changes: This tag is based upon /pop2/branch_tags/hrpop_tags/hrpop61_ccsm_pop_2_1_20080125
  Differences from hrpop61 include:
       * removal of cpl6 support.
       * the use of shr_sys_abort where needed (as a CCSMCOUPLED option that will remain in place 
         until Phil's new error trapping is fully functional)
       * error-trapping for SHF_QSW < epsilon in the high-res version
       * corrections to high-res settings in pop2_in_build.csh
       * parallel i/o development routines have not yet been ported to the pop2 trunk
