One-line Summary: Add normalized RMS output

Whenever there are RMS errors, add a field giving the normalized RMS
output. The result looks like this:

 RMS testvar                          3.1623E-01            NORMALIZED  5.6978E-02

The point of this is mostly to allow more useful sorting by RMS errors
in summarize_cprnc_diffs. Along those lines, summarize_cprnc_diffs has
been updated to use this normalized RMS value rather than the absolute
RMS value. 

Note that the normalization is done using the avg abs field
values. This differs from the definition of normalized RMSE that I
have found in some references, but seems good enough for these
purposes (and better in some cases, in that it is less sensitive to
outliers than, say [max - min]).

One-line Summary: Add tool for summarizing cprnc output

This post-processing script is meant to be run after you run a CESM
test suite. Example usage is the following - assuming the case
directories for your tests are in /glade/scratch/$USER/tests:

summarize_cprnc_diffs -basedir /glade/scratch/$USER/tests -testid 123456

The above command will generate three formatted reports in the current
directory. Each report contains the same information, but they are
sorted by different criteria: one is sorted by test name, one by
variable name, and one from highest to lowest RMS difference.

running over the original 180 length and causing tests to fail.

One-line Summary: fixed relative difference calculations

I made two changes to the relative difference calculation; Brian Eaton
agreed that both of these changes should be made:

(1) Normalized rdbar by s2, the number of indices where both variables
have valid values.

(2) In get_rdiff_stats_{TYPE}: Deleted a factor of 2 in the
denominator, in the computation of rdiff from vdiff. This factor of 2
dates back to at least circa 2001 versions of cprnc. The old code had
this cryptic comment:

! Test on half of difference field rather than full field due to 0.5 factor
! used in computation of "denom" later.

But as far as I can tell, this factor of 2 shouldn't be there.


Also renamed some variables to more accurately reflect their meaning.

Also added some test cases to check the relative difference
calculations.

Also updated README file to describe avg rel diff, avg decimal digits,
and worst decimal digits.

One-line Summary: fixed bug when first variable in file is non-numeric

Previously, the variables idiff, ifilldiff, ierr and inotfound were
not initialized to 0 in compare_vars, which was problematic whenever a
non-numeric variable was encountered (and thus compare_var_{TYPE}
wasn't called that time through the loop), and especially problematic
if the first variable encountered was non-numeric (in which case the
code used uninitialized variables).

Also replaced use of the temporary variable d1 in compare_var_{TYPE}
with an inline call to translate_loc within the call to get_dim_str
(the use of the temporary variable led to problems when compiling with
-qcheck and -qextcheck; the new way follows what is done elsewhere).

One-line Summary: changed behavior when differences in fill patterns

Changed status to DIFFERENT whenever there are fields for which there
are differences in fill pattern between the two files.

Added a count of the number of fields for which there are differences
in fill pattern; this is output in the final summary.

Updated README to be more correct.

Added simple netcdf files that can be used for testing, in
test_inputs/ (see test_inputs/README for details).
