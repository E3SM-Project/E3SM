High Order Method Modeling Environment

In 2010, HOMME transitioned to a GNU Autoconf/Automake build
system.  Please notice the new build system does not affect the directory
structure of the previous one. 

1. What do I need to know?
HOMME depends on the NetCDF and/or Parallel NetCDF libraries for system
IO. At least one of these needs to be pre-installed in your system for HOMME to
build. HOMME 

2. Building HOMME using GNU Autoconf/Automake.

Although the process to build HOMME with autoconf is rather simple
(just two steps), there are a number of significant environment
variables that control how the build process goes. To know what
variables and how to set them, there are a number of things you need
to know about your system in order set your environment right. 

We have included few examples of how to set the environment in the
file MACHINES. Please take a look there and see if you can use it as
an example for your specific system.

a. Compilers. 

HOMME is a combination of mostly Fortran 90 code, along
with some Forran 77 code in third party libraries and few files
written in C. Compilers are very strange creatures and although a
great deal of work has been done to standarize its use across
platform, it remains to this date the main divergence among systems.

First you need to set the variables that control what compiler you
wish to use. These are:

FC          The Fortran compiler command
MPIF90      The MPI Fortran compiler command
CC          C compiler command
MPICC       The MPI C compiler command
F77         Fortran 77 compiler command
FPP         C-preprocessor for Fortran source code

b. Compiler flags.

Each specific flag you wish to pass to your compilers is controlled by
the following environment variables:

CFLAGS      C compiler flags
CPPFLAGS    C/C++/Objective C preprocessor flags, e.g. -I<include dir> if
            you have headers in a nonstandard directory <include dir>
FCFLAGS     Fortran compiler flags (ignored by PIO's configure)
F90FLAGS    Fortran 90 compiler flags (note: used by PIO's configure)
FFLAGS      Fortran 77 compiler flags
FPPFLAGS    C-preprocessing flags for Fortran source code

c. Libraries Location.


d. Building the code

First build PIO, the timing library, blas and lapack:
% cd utils/pio
% ./configure  ; make -j4
(to run on lustre parallel file systems: ./configure --enable-filesystem-hints=lustre ; make -j )
% cd utils/timing ; make   
% cd libs/blas ; ./configure ; make
% cd libs/lapack ; ./configure ; make


Then build the code.  

Here is two examples which will build the shallow water and primitive equation code.
These assume PIO was build with both netcdf and pnetcdf support.  You can drop the
--with-pnetcdf option if PIO was only built with netcdf support.

cd build/sweqx 
./configure --enable-blas --enable-lapack --with-netcdf=$NETCDF_PATH \
   --with-pnetcdf=$PNETCDF_PATH NP=4 PLEV=1 
make depends
make clean
make

(To use the system blas and lapack librariers, the HOMME configure scripts,
i.e. build/preqx/configure, add HOMME_LIBS += "-llapack -lblas" and ommit
the --enable-blas and --enable-lapack options above)


An example which will build the 3D primitive equation model:

cd build/preqx
./configure --enable-blas --enable-lapack --with-netcdf=$NETCDF_PATH \
   --with-pnetcdf=$PNETCDF_PATH NP=4 PLEV=26  --enable-energy-diagnostics
make depends
make clean
make


e. Running the code
Once everything is in place that the code builds successfully, the easest
way to run the code is to start with one of the regression tests,
in test/reg_test.  A good place to start is shallow water test case 5,
    test/reg_test/individual_tests/swtc5.sh
The most "CAM-like" regression test is
    test/reg_test/individual_tests/baro2b.sh


f. Hybrid MPI/OPENMP
To run with openMP enabled, 
  1) add the necessary compilter option to FCFLAGS   ("-openmp for Intel Fortran).
  2) build the timing library with openMP support (edit utils/timing/Makefile
     and add CFLAGS+=-openmp -DTHREADED_OMP)
  3) build HOMME with -D_OPENMP  (Intel fortran will define this automatically
     if compilign with -openmp, so this may not be needed)
