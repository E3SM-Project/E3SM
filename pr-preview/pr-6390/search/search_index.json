This mode exclusively comprises sulfate aerosols, characterized by a smaller standard deviation (STD) value of 1.2. The STD value denotes the width of the aerosol mode, where a higher STD implies a greater gravitational settling effect (Wang et al., 2020;<sup>1</sup> Liu et al., 2012<sup>2</sup>). By setting the STD to 1.2, the simulated properties of volcanic aerosols align closely with observational findings (Mills et al., 2016).<sup>3</sup> MAM5 represents a pioneering aerosol model, effectively segregating tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols (Ke et al., in preparation), thereby mitigating the risk of overestimating dust and sea salt aerosols within the stratosphere in previous MAM4 (Visioni et al., 2021).<sup>4</sup> Volcanic eruptions derived from Neely and Schmidt (2016).<sup>5</sup></p>"},{"location":"EAM/tech-guide/mam/#mam4-overview","title":"MAM4 Overview","text":"<p>The representation of atmospheric aerosols and their roles in the Earth system by EAMv1/v2/v3 was inherited from the global aerosol-climate model EAMv0 and its four-mode modal aerosol module (MAM4), including Aitken, primary-carbon, accumulation, and coarse modes (Liu et al., 2016).<sup>6</sup> It treats a combination of processes, controlling the evolution of aerosols that are either directly emitted or converted from precursor gases from a variety of natural and anthropogenic sources. The processes include transport (by grid-scale wind, subgrid turbulence, convection, and sedimentation), aerosol microphysics (i.e., particle nucleation, condensation/evaporation of trace gases, aging, and coagulation), cloud processing (i.e., aqueous chemistry, scavenging by hydrometeors, resuspension from evaporating hydrometeors, and wet deposition), and dry deposition. Aerosol species in the original MAM4 (Liu et al., 2016)<sup>6</sup> include sulfate, primary organic aerosol (POA) or particulate organic matter (POM), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), black carbon (BC), sea salt, and mineral dust.

The assessment demonstrates that the convective microphysics scheme not only significantly improves the simulation of tropical variability across multiple scales but also enhances the simulation of climatological mean states.</p>"},{"location":"EAM/tech-guide/zm/#mass-flux-adjustment","title":"Mass flux adjustment","text":"<p>The convective mass flux adjustment (MAdj) is designed to represent the dynamical effects of large-scale vertical motion on convection. With MAdj, convection is enhanced (suppressed) when there is large-scale ascending (descending) motion at the planetary boundary layer top.

Sulfur from agriculture, domestic, transportation, waste, and shipping sectors is emitted at the surface while sulfur from energy and industry sectors is emitted at 100-300 m above the surface, and sulfur from forest fire and grass fire is emitted at higher elevations (0-6 km). POM and BC from forest fire and grass fire are emitted at 0-6 km, while those from other sources (domestic, energy, industry, transportation, waste, and shipping) are emitted at the surface. Injection height profiles for fire emissions are derived from the corresponding AeroCom profiles (Dentener et al., 2006)<sup>1</sup>, which give emissions in 6 altitude ranges (0-0.1, 0.1-0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2, 2-3, and 3-6 km). Otherwise, species emissions are assumed to be at the surface (bottom layer).

Typically,   you'll set this option to <code>Debug</code> or <code>Release</code>.</li> <li><code>CMAKE_{C,CXX,Fortran}_COMPILER</code>: the name of the command used to invoke an   MPI-enabled C, C++, or Fortran compiler to build EAMxx</li> <li><code>MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE</code>: the name of the command used to run EAMxx using MPI,   typically <code>mpiexec</code> or <code>mpirun</code>, but possibly different depending on your   desired machine</li> <li><code>EKAT_MPI_NP_FLAG</code>: the flag passed to <code>MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE</code> that you use to   specify the number of desired MPI processes. This is typically <code>-n</code> for   <code>mpiexec</code> and <code>-np</code> for <code>mpirun</code>.</li> <li><code>SCREAM_DYNAMICS_DYCORE</code>: specifies the dycore used for configuring EAMxx,   which is <code>NONE</code> if you are not configuring EAMxx to run its dycore-related   tests, or <code>HOMME</code> if you want to use HOMMExx</li> <li><code>SCREAM_DOUBLE_PRECISION</code>: indicates whether EAMxx's <code>Real</code> type is a   double-precision (<code>ON</code>) or single-precision (<code>OFF</code>) floating point type</li> <li><code>SCREAM_INPUT_ROOT</code>: specifies the location of the top-level folder that   stores input data files for EAMxx. This folder is populated with input files   which are downloaded automatically during EAMxx's build process.</li> <li>The Kokkos-related build options (most of which begin with <code>Kokkos_</code>) are   described in the Kokkos Wiki</li> <li><code>NetCDF_C_PATHS</code>: specifies one or more folders in which the NetCDF C library   and headers are installed.

Both the data and metadata are stored in <code>std::shared_ptr</code> instances, to ensure consistency across all copies of the field. This allows for fast shallow copy semantic for this class.</p> <p>The data is stored on both CPU and device memory (these may be the same, depending on the Kokkos backend). In EAMxx, we always assume and guarantee that the device data is up to date. That implies that the data be explicitly synced to host before using it on host, and explicitly synced to device after host manipulation, in order to ensure correctness. In order to access the data, users must use the <code>get_view</code> method, which takes two template arguments: the data type, and an enum specifying whether CPU or device data is needed. The data type is used to reinterpret the generic pointer stored inside to a view of the correct scalar type and layout. It is a possibly const-qualified type, and if the field was marked as \"read-only\", the method ensures that the provided data type is const. A read-only field can be created via the <code>getConst</code> method, which returns an identical copy of the field, but marked as read-only. The enum specifying host or device data is optional, with device being the default.</p> <p>The metadata is a collection of information on the field, such as name, layout, units, allocation size, and more. Part of the metadata is immutable after creation (e.g., name, units, or layout), while some metadata can be partially or completely modified. The metadata is contained in the <code>FieldHeader</code> data structure, which contains four parts:</p> <ul> <li><code>FieldIdentifier</code>: stores the field's name, layout, units, data type, and name of the grid where it's defined.   These information are condensed in a single string, that can be used to uniquely identify a field,   allowing to distinguish between different version of the same field. The layout is stored in the <code>FieldLayout</code>   data structure, which includes:<ul> <li>the field tags: stored as a <code>std::vector&lt;FieldTag&gt;</code>, they give context to the field's extents.</li> <li>the field dims: stored both as a <code>std::vector&lt;int&gt;</code>, as well as a 1d <code>Kokkos::View</code>.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>FieldTracking</code>: stores information on the usage of the field, as well as its possible connections to other   fields. In particular, the tracked items are:<ul> <li>the field time stamp: the time stamp when the field was last updated.</li> <li>the field accumulation start time: used for fields that are accumulated over several time steps   (or time step subcycles). For instance, it allows to reconstruct fluxes from raw accumulations.</li> <li>the providers/customers: lists of atmosphere processes (see below) that respectively require/compute   the field in their calculations.</li> <li>the field groups: a list of field groups that this field belongs too. Field groups are used to access   a group of fields without explicit prior knowledge about the number and/or names of the fields.</li> </ul> </li> <li><code>FieldAllocProp</code>: stores information about the allocation. While the field is not yet allocated, users can   request special allocations for the field, for instance to accommodate packing (for SIMD), which may   require padding. Upon allocation, this information is then used by the Field structure to extract the   actual data, wrapped in a properly shaped <code>Kokkos::View</code>. The alloc props are also responsible of tracking   additional information in case the field is a \"slice\" of a higher-dimensional one, a fact that can affect   how the data is accessed.</li> <li>Extra data: stored as a <code>std::map&lt;std::string,ekat::any&gt;</code>, allows to catch any metadata that does not fit   in the above structures. This is a last resort structure, intended to accommodate the most peculiar   corner cases, and should be used sparingly.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"EAMxx/developer/grid/","title":"Grids and Remappers","text":""},{"location":"EAMxx/developer/grid/#grids-and-remappers","title":"Grids and Remappers","text":"<p>In EAMxx, the <code>AbstractGrid</code> is an interface used to access information regarding the horizontal and vertical discretization.

Based on a series of 3D Monte Carlo photon tracing simulations, Lee et al. (2011)<sup>3</sup> built a multiple linear regression parameterization to predict these four relative deviations well. The parameterization of Lee et al. (2011)<sup>3</sup> uses four variables that include the standard deviation of elevation (\\(\\sigma_h\\)) within a grid cell, grid-averaged values of cosine of the local solar incident angle (\\(\\mu\\)), sky view factor (\\(\\overline{V_d}\\)), and terrain configuration factor (\\(\\overline{C_T}\\)). Lee et al.

For an unobstructed infinite slope with the slope of \\(\\alpha\\) and aspect of \\(\\beta\\) and a given solar illumination geometry (i.e., solar zenith angle, \\(SZA\\), and solar azimuth angle, \\(SAA\\)), the cosine of the local solar incident angle (\\(\\mu\\)) can be calculated by</p> \\[ \\mu = \\cos(SZA) \\cos(\\alpha) + \\sin(SZA) \\sin(\\alpha) \\cos(SAA-\\beta) \\] <p>The \\(SZA\\) and \\(SAA\\) are assumed to be constant within a grid cell, but \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) vary within a grid cell.

The land surface albedo is adjusted, instead of modifying incoming solar radiation, to maintain the surface energy conservation and the consistency between the surface and the first levels of atmosphere above the surface (Lee et al., 2015).
