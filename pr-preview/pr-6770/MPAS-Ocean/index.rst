MPAS-Ocean
==========

The Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) Ocean is a collaborative project
for developing an ocean component for use in climate, regional climate, and
weather studies. Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) has primary
responsibility for the ocean models. It is built on the MPAS framework which
facilitates the rapid development and prototyping of models by providing
infrastructure typically required by model developers, including high-level
data types, communication routines, and I/O routines.
