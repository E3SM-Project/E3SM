One-line summary: Python refactoring and environment changes.

A       python/environment.py
A       python/test_environment.py
        - New classes for dealing with modules.
        - "expand_env" function
        - SoftEnvInterface is present, but still not ready for use.

M       python/machine_setup.py
        - Start refactoring to shift toward a more object oriented
          approach.
        - Add yellowstone/PGI module.
        - Start moving toward MPI support.

M       python/printer.py
        - Change CMakePrinter name to ScriptPrinter, add very basic
          indentation hook.

M       python/xml_test_list.py
        - Correct docstring grammar.

M       python/xml_utils.py
M       python/test_xml_utils.py
        - Add ability to ignore attributes.
        - Add "elements_to_dict" dictionary translation function.
        - These are not currently used, but were added in anticipation of
          environment xml file changes.

M       run_tests.py
        - Changes needed due to interface changes in other modules.
        - "-R" option replaced with "-T", which is a generic way to add
          arguments to CTest.
        - Add --use-mpi option (only changes compiler command determined
          from Machines currently).
        - Change Machines directory detection. Machines is now considered
          optional if not using a CESM build type, but is mandatory
          otherwise.
        - Fix bug where environment was not loaded correctly when
          rebuilding without "--clean" on yellowstone.
        - Remove CESM_Macros.CMake when cleaning a build.
        - Fail when make fails, instead of passing "-k" and ignoring the
          error code. This is too dangerous; the ability to keep going can
          be reimplemented when we have a more nuanced way to detect and
          alert the user to build errors.

         - Switch to new, somewhat lower level CMake interface.
         - In this version, all tests are ultimately CTest tests.

M       README
         - Update documentation with changes, reduce documentation that's
           redundant with the explanations in the module files themselves.

M       run_tests.py
         - Improve autodetection.
         - Allow CESM root directory to be specified, and use it for
           autodetection of other paths (including genf90.pl now).
         - Increase verbosity of CTest when "-v" option is given.

One-line summary: Address issues mentioned in review, prototype XML lists.

M       Examples/circle_area/tests/CTest/test_driver.F90
M       Examples/interpolate_1d/tests/CTest/test_driver.F90
        - Correct the example assert function to be an actual assert with
          an error message.

A       Examples/test_list.xml
        - List of all test directories in one XML file.

M       cmake/CESM_utils.cmake
A       cmake/Sourcelist_utils.cmake
A       cmake/genf90_utils.cmake
A       cmake/pFUnit_utils.cmake
        - Separate utility functions into three new modules.
        - pFUnit and genf90 functions each get a new module.
        - Sourcelist_utils provides functions to help manage source files
          based on directory (i.e. to build as if using a Makefile VPATH).

A       python/comparable.py
M       python/xml_utils.py
M       python/test_xml_utils.py
        - Add workarounds to keep things working on both Python 2.6 and
          Python 3.
        - Most of these workarounds are *not* necessary in Python 2.7,
          because.

A       python/printer.py
        - Fix bug that prevented error messages from being printed.

A       python/xml_test_list.py
A       python/test_xml_test_list.py
        - Add parser for an XML test list and tests for that module.

M       run_tests.py
        - Add XML test list functionality.
        - Build directory is now specified with a named option
          ("--build-dir"), so there are no naked arguments left.
        - Put some sections of run_tests.py into functions so that it's
          easier to loop over them (for test lists).

M       README
        - Document above changes.

        - Move python modules to a new python directory.
        - Changes made for better compliance with PEP 8 and PEP 257
          (the python.org style guides). This includes more detail in
          docstrings, and having modules define __all__.
        - Reduced the scope of some import statements.
        - Mild improvements to machine_setup.make_cmake_macros
          implementation.

D       cmake/CMakeMacros.pl
        - Removed in favor of python implementation (which was needed to
          extract compiler information more easily anyway).

M       cmake/Compilers.cmake
        - Fix issue where -kind=byte was not being specified for NAG.

M       run_tests.py
        - "--compiler" option is now case insensitive.
        - "CESM_DEBUG" is now the default build type.
        - "--test-spec-dir" is now an option; test specification directory
          is no longer a mandatory option (to allow test lists later).

One-line summary: Start ChangeLog, depend only on Machines, not scripts.

A       ChangeLog
        - Start this log.

M       cmake/CMakeMacros.pl
        - Fix bug. Note that this isn't being used right now, and may go
          away anyway, so the fix is really just in case there's a need to
          resuscitate this in the future.

M       cmake/CESM_utils.cmake
M       cmake/Compilers.cmake
        - Remove config_compilers related logic, as this is now handled in
          the python scripts.

M       test_xml_utils.py
M       xml_utils.py
        - Rename "xmltree" to "xml_tree" and "node" to "element".
        - Add all_matches function to xml parsing, and tests for it.

M       printer.py
        - Add CMakePrinter, and add "comment" method to Printer base class.

M       machine_setup.py
        - Add module loads for yellowstone.
        - Do all XML parsing of config_compilers here.

M       run_tests.py
        - Changes for machine_setup interface, and changing option to show
          that this script only depends on Machines.
