ABOUT THIS TOOL
===============

This directory contains a shell script that uses ESMF's ESMF_RegridWeightGen
utility to generate a suite of mapping files to map between specified grid
files. It does not call the ESMF tool directly, rather the script

gen_ESMF_mapping_file/create_ESMF_map.sh

is used as a wrapper. If you only want to generate a single mapping file, you
should use that script (see the README file in the gen_ESMF_mapping_file/
directory for details).

To use this tool, specify some (or all) of the following: atmosphere grid (atm),
ocean grid (ocn), land grid (lnd), and runoff grid (rtm). Depending on what
grids are used as input, the following maps will be generated:

 * atm -> ocn: conservative, bilinear, patch
 * ocn -> atm: conservative, bilinear
 * atm -> lnd: conservative, bilinear
 * lnd -> atm: conservative
 * ocn -> lnd: conservative
 * lnd -> rtm: conservative
 * rtm -> lnd: conservative

If you specify a runoff grid but not a land grid, the utility will use the
atmosphere grid instead. If you want to make a rtm -> ocn mapping file, you
should use the tool found in

runoff_to_ocn/

The conservative ocn to atm mapping file should be used as input to gen_domain,
which is located in

../gen_domain_files/ (and must be built in gen_domain_files/src/)

If the ocean and atm grids are identical then the mapping file will simply be
unity and the atm fraction will be one minus the ocean fraction.

All maps generated will be checked for global consistency by the tool found in

../check_maps/

See the README file in that directory for more details, but basically the tool
is based on ESMF's ESMF_RegridWeightGenCheck untility. It maps 5 different
global patterns from source to destination and compares the errors; for any
conservative maps, it also checks for conservation. Note that this tool must be
built prior to running gen_cesm_maps.sh, unless you use the --nogridcheck or
--recompile option. Skipping the grid check is not recommended.

where 
 --fileatm (or -fatm) 
   SCRIP grid format atmosphere filename (full pathname)
 --fileocn (or -focn) 
   SCRIP grid format ocean filename (full pathname)
 --filelnd (or -flnd) 
   SCRIP grid format land filename (full pathname), must be global
 --filertm (or -frtm) 
   SCRIP grid format runoff filename (full pathname)
 --nameatm (or -natm) 
   Shortname to use for atm in mapping filename
 --nameocn (or -nocn) 
   Shortname to use for ocn in mapping filename
 --namelnd (or -nlnd) 
   Shortname to use for lnd in mapping filename

   Shortname to use for rtm in mapping filename
 --typeocn (or -tocn) 
   ocean grid type,  valid values are regional or global
   default is global
 --typeatm (or -tatm) 
   atm grid type, valid values are regional or global
   default is global
   value must be global if -frtm and -nrtm are specified
 --nogridcheck 
   By default, script will run consistency check on new
   maps; this flag disables these checks
 --batch (or -b) 
   Toggles batch mode usage. If you want to run in batch mode
   you need to have a separate batch script for a supported machine
   that calls this script interactively - you cannot submit this
   script directly to the batch system
 -rc 
   Pass the "--recompile" flag to the ESMF tool
   (Only necessary if nothing has been built in ../check_maps/)
 -d 
   toggle debug-only 
 --help or -h  
   displays this help message

Note: if rtm is specified and lnd is not, then this tool will
      assume lnd and atm are on the same grid.

You can also set the following env variables:
  ESMFBIN_PATH - Path to ESMF binaries 
                 (Leave unset on yellowstone and caldera and the tool
                 will be loaded from modules)
  MPIEXEC ------ Name of mpirun executable
                 (default is mpirun.lsf on yellowstone and caldera; if
                 you run interactively on yellowstone, mpi is not used)
  REGRID_PROC -- Number of MPI processors to use
                 (default is 8)

=================
USAGE: BATCH MODE
=================

Currently, batch mode is only set up for yellowstone. This uses the file
regridbatch.yellowstone.sh as a wrapper to gen_cesm_maps.sh.

IMPORTANT NOTE: check_maps is NOT run when you run in batch mode. This must be
run as a separate step after you have created the mapping files. See below for
an example of how to do this.

(1) Modify the #BSUB lines at the top of regridbatch.yellowstone.sh. You need to
at least specify a project number; you may want to change some of the other
settings, too.

(2) Modify the variables in the section labeled "Set user-defined parameters
here". See the documentation for gen_cesm_maps.sh above for more details on
the parameters that can be set here.

(3) Submit with:

bsub < regridbatch.yellowstone.sh

(4) Run the check_maps tool on the generated mapping files; e.g.:

    files=*.nc
    ../check_maps/check_map.sh $files
