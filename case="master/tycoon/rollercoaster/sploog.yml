Artifactory provides tight integration with Ivy and is the source through which your builds resolve dependencies and the target for deploying the build output.
Ivy and Artifactory
Secure, private Ivy repositories

Full Automation with REST API and JFrog CLI

Enterprise Ready


IVY Repository
Reliable and Optimized Builds

Universal Solution

Secure, private Ivy repositories
Use secure, private, local Ivy repositories to share Ivy packages across your organization with fine-grained access control. Proxy and cache public resources with remote repositories, and aggregate local and remote resources under a single virtual Ivy repository to access all your packages from a single URL.
Full Automation with REST API and JFrog CLI
Artifactory exposes an extensive REST API that provides access to its features anywhere in the development cycle effectively letting you automate any action you could do through the UI. JFrog CLI is a compact and smart client that greatly simplifies and optimizes automation scripts making them more efficient, more readable and easier to maintain across all JFrog products. Between them, the REST API and JFrog CLI facilitate fully automated and optimized software delivery when working with Ivy.
Enterprise Ready
Artifactory offers unique capabilities for enterprise-grade artifact management. An Enterprise Artifactory installation provides High Availability with unmatched stability and reliability accommodating any number of users, build servers and interactions. To match High Availability, a variety of storage options include cloud-based providers that offer massively scalable storage that can accommodate terabyte-laden repositories. And to support globally distributed enterprises, Artifactory offers advanced replication options that support any network topology over multiple, geographically distant sites facilitating disaster recovery with instant failover to a DR site anywhere in the world.
Reliable and Optimized Builds
Running Ivy builds through Artifactory reduces build times by significantly reducing networking. When remote artifacts are downloaded, Artifactory stores them in a remote repository cache, making them locally available for builds without the need for any networking. This also makes your builds more reliable since they are not dependent on the network or remote resources. Even if a remote repository goes down, or there is an issue with the network, your Ivy builds will succeed since remote artifacts are available from the local cache.
Universal Solution
As a universal repository manager, Artifactory supports all major package formats and provides the same fully-featured artifact management with exhaustive metadata for any development technology. Artifactory is also tightly integrated with all major build tools and CI servers and comfortably sits at the heart of any development ecosystem.
