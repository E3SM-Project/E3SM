Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM)
================================================================================

E3SM is a state-of-the-art fully coupled model of the Earth's climate including
important biogeochemical and cryospheric processes. It is intended to address
the most challenging and demanding climate-change research problems and
Department of Energy mission needs while efficiently using DOE Leadership
Computing Facilities.

Quick Start
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The [Quick Start](https://e3sm.org/model/running-e3sm/e3sm-quick-start/) page 
includes instructions on obtaining the necessary code and input data for model 
setup and execution.

Supported Machines 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E3SM is high-performance computing application and generally requires a cluster
with several hundred nodes to run a scientifically validated case at a useful
simulation speed.

To run E3SM, it is recommended that you obtain time on [Supported Machine]
(https://e3sm.org/model/running-e3sm/supported-machines/)

Running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please refer to [Running E3SM](https://e3sm.org/model/running-e3sm/) 
 for instructions on running the model. 

Contributing
