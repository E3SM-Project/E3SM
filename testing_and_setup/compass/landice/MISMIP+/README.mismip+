Instructions for setting up and running the MISMIP+ experiments with MPAS Landice

See this paper for details on MISMIP+:

X. S. Asay-Davis et al. (2016), Experimental design for three interrelated
marine ice sheet and ocean model intercomparison projects:
MISMIP v. 3 (MISMIP+), ISOMIP v. 2 (ISOMIP+) and MISOMIP v. 1 (MISOMIP1),
Geosci. Model Devel., 9, 2471-2497, doi: 10.5194/gmd-9-2471-2016.

The following experiments are included in MISMIP+:

Ice0          100-year control simulation with no melting 
Ice1r         100-year run with melt-induced retreat
Ice1ra        100-year (or optionally up to 900-year) simulation from end of Ice1r with no melting
Ice1rr        Continue Ice1r for a further 900 years (optional) 
Ice2r         100-year “calving-event” simulation
Ice2ra        100-year (or optionally up to 900-year) simulation from end of Ice2r with no melting
Ice2rr        Continue Ice2r for a further 900 years (optional)

Each starts from a spun-up state with a stable grounding line (GL).
Reaching a stable state typically requires ~10,000 to 20,000 years.

The first step is to set up the MISMIP+ test cases in a work directory.
Go to your MPAS-Code directory.  You should see a directory structure like this:

|–– test_cases
    |––ocean
       |–– list_testcases.py
       |–– setup_testcase.py
       |–– general.config.landice
       |–– [Other files and directories}
       |–– landice
           |–– [dome, EISMINT2, greenland, MISMIP3d, etc.]
           |–– MISMIP+
               |–– README.mismip+
               |–– albany_input.xml
               |–– cull_cells_for_MISMIP.py
               |–– mismip+PlotGL.py
               |–– mismip+WriteGL.py
               |–– mismip+_template.xml
               |–– setup_mismip+_initial_conditions.py
               |── setup_mismip+_subdirectories.py
               |── standard_resolution
                   |── standard_test
                       |–– README
                       |–– config_setup_experiments.xml
                       |–– namelist.input
                       |–– namelist.input.500m
                       |–– namelist.input.1000m
                       |–– namelist.input.2000m
                       |–– namelist.input.4000m
                       |── namelist.input.8000m

First decide what resolution you would like to run. The resolution is set by the
files namelist.input and config_setup_experiments.xml in the lowest-level directory.
The default is 2000 m. To change the default (say, to 1000 m):

    > cp namelist.input.1000m namelist.input

Then change "2000m" to "1000m" in the second line of config_setup_experiments.xml.

For testing and debugging, you may prefer a coarser resolution (say, 8000 m) that is 
less accurate but will run quickly.

Next, go up to ...MPAS-Code/test_cases/ocean
You will need a custom version of general.config.landice containing the paths on
your machine to various files and directories. See the general instructions here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aURr4UdEm0AMeYlc478yL_46biD19naVp3nCMYgrYLI/edit?pref=2&pli=1#heading=h.ri8fp83u0zch

List the available tests:

     > ./list_testcases.py

The MISMIP+ test should be listed with a number (say, 26). To set up the tests:

     > ./setup_testcase.py -o landice -n 26 -f general.config.landice --work_dir myWorkDir

Go to your work directory (myWorkDir).  Say you set up a test with 2000m resolution.
You should have a directory structure like this:

|––myWorkDir
   |––landice
      |––MISMIP+
         |––standard_resolution
            |––standard_test
               |––2000m

Go to subdirectory 2000m (or whichever resolution you set up).

There should be a link to your executable (landice_model) and other files needed for setup.
Note: The executable must have been built with support for the Albany first-order dycore.
      (e.g., with 'make CORE=landice ALBANY=true gfortran')

Run the setup script:

     > python setup_test.py

This script will create the required input file, landice_grid.nc.
The grid information for this resolution is contained in namelist.input.

In addition, this script will create the following subdirectories:
- Spinup
- Ice0
- Ice1r
- Ice1ra
- Ice1rr
- Ice1rax
- Ice1rrx
- Ice2r
- Ice2ra
- Ice2rr
- Ice2rax
- Ice2rrx
Note: Ice1ra and Ice1rax are two parts of the same 900-year experiment,
      and similarly for the other Ice*x files.
      Ice1ra runs from year 100 to year 200 with output every 10 years,
      whereas Ice1rax runs from year 200 to year 1000 with output every 100 years.

Each subdirectory should contain the following files:
- a link to the executable
- a link to the graph.info.part.* files in the parent directory
- namelist and streams files for the experiment. These files are modified from a template
  file to include the correct start time, stop time, and output intervals, along with 
  basal melt settings appropriate to each experiment.
- a link to landice_grid.nc (in the Spinup directory)
- a link to ../Spinup/landice_grid.nc (for Ice0, Ice1r and Ice2r)
- a restart_timestamp file and a link to the appropriate restart file
  (for the Ice* experiments that restart from Ice1r or Ice2r)

Initially, the links in the Ice* directories will be empty, but they will be populated as the user
carries out the experiments. Experiments should be done in this order:
- Run the Spinup.
- Ice0, Ice1r and Ice2r can be done once the spinup is complete.
- Ice1ra and Ice1rr must follow Ice1r; Ice2ra and Ice2rr must follow Ice2r.
- Ice1rax must follow Ice1ra, and similarly for the other Ice*x.

The first step is to run the Spinup experiment. By default, this experiment runs for 15,000 years.

Note 1: You may want to change the length of the Spinup.  To do this, go to the Spinup directory 
        and edit config_stop_time in namelist.landice. For instance, you could change this:
             config_stop_time = '15000-01-01_00:00:00'
        to this:
             config_stop_time = '10000-01-01_00:00:00'

Note 2: Each subdirectory will have links to the graph.info.part files in the parent directory.
        To run on a different number of cores, you can make your own file using METIS.
        For example, to run on 128 cores on the LANL IC machines:
        > module load metis
        > gpmetis graph.info 128

Note 3: There is a namelist parameter called config_default_flowParamA.  
        However, this parameter does *not* determine the flow parameter for the higher-order model.
        To change this parameter, open the file .../MPAS-Code/test_cases/ocean/landice/MISMIP+/albany_input.xml
        Scroll down to these lines:

             <!-- Note that because of the units used in Albany, the value for A in input file is 10^12 times the usual value in Pa^{-n} yr^{-1}. -->
             <Parameter name="Glen's Law A" type="double" value="0.00002"/>

        The default value corresponds to A = 2.0e-17 Pa^{-3} yr^{-1}, as suggested by Asay-Davis et al. (2016).
        To set A = 4.0-17 Pa^{-3} yr^{-1} (for example), you would set value="0.00004".

Note 4: The MISMIP+ protocols allow one of three kinds of basal sliding law. 
        MPAS LI uses a Weertman-type power law (Eq. 6 of Asay-Davis et al.).
        This basal sliding law is set in albany_input.xml:

             <!-- power law basal friction law: -->
             <Parameter name="BetaXY" type="string" value="Power Law Scalar Field"/>

        The basal traction coefficient beta is created by setup_mismip+_initial_conditions.py.
        The power-law exponent m = 1/3 is currently hardwired in Albany.
        The other two MISMIP+ sliding laws, based on Tsai et al. (2015) and Schoof (2005), are not yet supported in MPAS LI.

Once you are satisfied with the configuration, you can launch the Spinup run. For example:

     > cd Spinup
     > mpirun -n 16 landice_model

Or alternatively, you can submit a batch job with a simple run script. (I usually use msub on LANL IC machines.)

At resolutions of 2 km or finer, you will probably want more than 16 cores.
I usually use 128 to 256 cores at 2 km resolution on the IC machines.

At coarse resolution (e.g, 8 km), a 15,000-year run typically takes only a couple of hours.
At finer resolutions it will take longer, and you may need to restart the run.
Say you want to restart from year 10000, and you have a file called restart_10000.nc.
You also have a one-line file called restart_timestamp, which is overwritten at each restart interval.
Say the timestamp is '10000-01-01_00:00:00'. Then you would edit namelist.landice:

     config_do_restart = .true.
     config_start_time = 'file'

Continue restarting as needed until the Spinup is complete.

After a 15,000-year run, you should have a restart file called restart_15000.nc.
This file provides the initial condition for Ice0, Ice1r and Ice2r, but you first have to rename it
and removed the 'xtime' variable so that MPASLI will launch an initial run (rather than a restart)
and will not be confused about the start time.

An easy way to process the restart file is with the 'ncks' command of NCO.
You may first need to load NCO:

     > module load nco

In the Spinup directory, remove the existing symbolic link to landice_grid.nc:

     > rm landice_grid.nc

Then remove the xtime variable and rename the final restart file to landice_grid.nc:

     > ncks -x -v xtime restart_15000.nc landice_grid.nc

The Ice0, Ice1r and Ice2r directories should already contain a symbolic link
to the file you just created.

Then go to the Ice0 directory. Simply launch the run, e.g.:

     > mpirun -n 16 landice_model

Continue in the required order (as described above) until the MISMIP+ run suite is complete.

Each Ice* subdirectory should contain a standard output file called output_00000.nc,
with output written at the appropriate interval (every 10 years to year 200, then
every 100 years to year 1000). These files need to be converted to the format
specified by Asay-Davis et al. (2016). To do this, go to the main directory
(e.g., .../standard_test/8000m) and run a python script:

     > python mismip+WriteGL.py -x all

For each experiment, you should get a netCDF file in MISMIP+ format and a test plot.
For example, the Ice0 directory should contain the files Ice0_MPASLI.nc
and plot_Ice0_MPASLI.pdf. The plot should show the advance or retreat of the GL
during the course of the experiment.

This script can also be run for one experiment at a time. For example:

      > python mismip+WriteGL.py -x Ice1r

The script will not work if the output file does not contain all the expected time slices.

Finally, there is another python script that makes two plots (in one file,
called mismip+PlotGL.pdf) synthesizing the results of all the experiments:

     > python mismip+PlotGL.py

The upper plot shows the GL location at the start and end of different experiments.
The lower plot shows the total grounded area over time for each experiment, in analogy 
to Figure 4 of Asay-Davis et al. (2016).

Good luck!  Please let me know (lipscomb@lanl.gov) if you have questions or run into problems.
