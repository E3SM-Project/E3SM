# To run all unit tests on yellowstone, run the following commands:

# Do this once per login
module load cmake
unit_test_dir=/glade/scratch/$USER/unit_tests_drv

# Do this only if you are running from a different CLM checkout than
# the previous time you built unit tests in this directory. (This
# probably isn't necessary, but it's best to do this to be safe.)
rm -rf $unit_test_dir

# Here is the main command
CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE=1 ../../tools/unit_testing/run_tests.py --build-dir=$unit_test_dir --test-spec-dir=. --compiler=intel  --build-type=CESM_DEBUG
